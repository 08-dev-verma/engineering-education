### Introduction
Data encryption is an important feature of data protection. There are different methods of data encryption and decryption used to encrypt and decrypt data to enhance the safety of data transmitted.

In this article, we will look at AES as a method of data encryption and decryption. AES, `Advanced Encryption Standard is a block cipher text encryption and decryption algorithm that process a block of 128 bits of data using secret keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

In this article, we will be discussing how this algorithm can be implemented in Java and how it is processed.

### Prerequisites
For a better understanding of this article, you will need to have:
- A java development environment. That is, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=9736964638&gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiNOwE9JwyLDkoU1GpO5pX7drlhJMi3417AGha6fh1oudpCIhXUNTj0aAiOoEALw_wcB#section=windows)
- A basic knowledge of [Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm)

### An overview of AES algorithm
`AES` is a 128-bit symmetric block ciphertext. This algorithm uses substitution and permutations, called the `SP networks`. It consists of multiple texts to produce a ciphertext.
### Java imports
In our program to create the AES algorithm, we will import the following java packages.

```Java
import java.security.key;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;
import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;
```

### AES implementation in Java
To start our implementation, we will create a public class and call it `JavaAes` that can be accessed by any instance of the class in the program. This class will consist of two variables, i.e; One variable is of `String` type. This variable will hold the algorithm which is the `AES` and a byte data type array that will hold the key values.This is the secret key used to encrypt data. The code snippet below expounds on this class.

```java
public class JavaAes{
    private static final String ALGORITHM = "AES";
    private byte [] keyValue;
}
```

We will then create a public example and pass in the key as one of the variables of type string. This variables is assigned to key values which is converted to bytes using the `getBytes` method. Have a look at the code below:

```java
public javaAes(String key){
    keyValue = key.getBytes();
}
```

### AES encryption
We can now implement encryption of this algorithm. We will start by creating the encrypt method and pass in the data to be encrypted. This method throws an exception.

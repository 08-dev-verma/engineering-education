### Introduction
Data encryption is an important feature of data protection. There are different methods of data encryption and decryption methods used to encrypt and decrypt data to enhance the safety of data transmitted.

In this article, we will look at AES as a method of data encryption and decryption. AES, `Advanced Encryption Standard` is a block cipher encryption and decryption algorithm that process a block of 128 bits of data using secret keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

In this article, we will be discussing how this algorithm can be implemented in Java and how it is processed.

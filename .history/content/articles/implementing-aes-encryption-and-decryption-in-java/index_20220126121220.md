### Introduction
Data encryption is an important feature of data protection. There are different methods of data encryption and decryption used to encrypt and decrypt data to enhance the safety of data transmitted.

In this article, we will look at AES as a method of data encryption and decryption. AES, `Advanced Encryption Standard is a block cipher text encryption and decryption algorithm that process a block of 128 bits of data using secret keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

In this article, we will be discussing how this algorithm can be implemented in Java and how it is processed.

### Prerequisites
For a better understanding of this article, you will need to have:
- A java development environment. That is, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=9736964638&gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiNOwE9JwyLDkoU1GpO5pX7drlhJMi3417AGha6fh1oudpCIhXUNTj0aAiOoEALw_wcB#section=windows)
- A basic knowledge of [Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm)

### An overview of AES algorithm
`AES` is a 128-bit symmetric block ciphertext. This algorithm uses substitution and permutations, called the `SP networks`. It consists of multiple texts to produce a ciphertext.
### Java imports
In our program to create the AES algorithm, we will import the following java packages.

```Java
import java.security.key;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import sun.misc.BASE64Decoder;
import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;
```

### AES implementation in Java
To start our implementation, we will create a public class and call it `JavaAes` that can be accessed by any instance of the class in the program. This class will consist of two variables, i.e; One variable is of `String` type. This variable will hold the algorithm which is the `AES` and a byte data type array that will hold the key values.This is the secret key used to encrypt data. The code snippet below expounds on this class.

```java
public class JavaAes{
    private static final String ALGORITHM = "AES";
    private byte [] keyValue;
}
```

We will then create a public example and pass in the key as one of the variables of type string. This variables is assigned to key values which is converted to bytes using the `getBytes` method. Have a look at the code below:

```java
public javaAes(String key){
    keyValue = key.getBytes();
}
```

### AES encryption
We can now implement encryption of this algorithm. We will start by creating the encrypt method and pass in the data to be encrypted. This method returns the string value and throws an exception.

First, we need to create a key and assign it to the `genarateKey` method. We will then create an object to obtain the instance of the AES algorithm. The `c.init` method then initializes the ciphertext to the `CipherText.ENCRYPT_MODE` with the key that had been generated.

```java
public String encrypt(String Message) throws Exception {
    Key key = generateKey();
    CipherText ct = CipherText.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
    ct.init(CipherText.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
    byte[]encodedValue = ct.doFinal(Message.getBytes());
    String encryptVal = new BASE64Encoder().encode(encryptValue);
    return encryptVal;
}
```

From the code snippet below;
- The `c.doFinal` is a method used to encrypt the key values. It is passed to our method of type string message and converted into bytes in this method. This bytes are then passed to the `doFinal` method.
- The encrypted values are passed to the `encryptVal` of type string and encoded to `BASE64` encoding and returned to encrypted value.

### AES Decryption
In decryption, we first create a method called `decrypt` and then pass in the encrypted message which is of type `string`.
- We will then generate a key by calling the generate method.
- We then obtain the cipher object by using the `getInstance` method.
- The next thing is to initialize our cipher object as `DECRYPT_MODE` and pass in the key generated.
- We then decode the encrypted data using the `.decodeBuffer` method.
- After decoding the message, we will call the `c.doFinal` which is a value of type byte array. This will will stored in string value of the decrypted value.
- We will the return the decrypted message in this method.

```java
public String decrypt(String encryptedMessage) throws Exception{
    Key k = generateKey();
    CipherText ct = CipherText.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
    ct.init(CipherText.DECRYPT_MODE, key);
    byte[] decodeValue = new BASE64Decoder().decodeBuffer(encryptedMessage);
    byte decodedValue = ct.doFinal(decodeValue);
    String decryptedValue = new String(decodedValue);
    return decodedValue;
}
```

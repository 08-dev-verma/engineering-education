### Introduction
Data encryption is an important feature of data protection. There are different methods of data encryption and decryption used to encrypt and decrypt data to enhance the safety of data transmitted.

In this article, we will look at AES as a method of data encryption and decryption. AES, `Advanced Encryption Standard is a block cipher text encryption and decryption algorithm that process a block of 128 bits of data using secret keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

In this article, we will be discussing how this algorithm can be implemented in Java and how it is processed.

### Prerequisites
For a better understanding of this article, you will need to have:
- A java development environment. That is, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=9736964638&gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiNOwE9JwyLDkoU1GpO5pX7drlhJMi3417AGha6fh1oudpCIhXUNTj0aAiOoEALw_wcB#section=windows)
- A basic knowledge of [Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm)

### An overview of AES algorithm
`AES` is a 128-bit symmetric block ciphertext. This algorithm uses substitution and permutations, called the `SP networks`. It consists of multiple texts to produce a ciphertext.
### Java imports
In our program to create the AES algorithm, we will import the following java packages.

```Java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.KeyGenerator;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.GCMParameterSpec;
import java.util.Base64;
```

### AES implementation in Java
We will start by creating a java class and call it `AES_ENCRYPTION`. In our class we will create an `init` method. This method will create the encryption keys.
In this method, using a key generator, we will generate one key. We will get the key generator instance of `AES` and assign it to `keyGenerator`. We are then required to initialize the key size. The key sizes values can be of 128, 192 0r 256 bytes.In this article we shall be using key size value of 128 bytes.

The code below can be used to implement this:

```java
public class AES_ENCRYPTION {
    private SecretKey key;
    private final int KEY_SIZE = 128;
    private final int DATA_LENGTH = 128;
    private Cipher encryptionCipher;

    public void init() throws Exception {
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGenerator.init(KEY_SIZE);
        key = keyGenerator.generateKey();
    }
```

### Encryption
Now that we have initialized our keys, we will start encrypting. We will start by creating an encrypt method and pass in the data that is to be encrypted.
We then need to guess the byte array from this message, create an encryption cipher and get its instance. We then need to initial the encryption cipher with the `init` method using the `Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE` and pass in a parameter which is the key that we have generated.

The last thing to do the encrypt method is to create a method `encryptionCipher` that will return a byte array of the encrypted data.

```java
public String encrypt(String data) throws Exception {
        byte[] dataInBytes = data.getBytes();
        encryptionCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding");
        encryptionCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);
        byte[] encryptedBytes = encryptionCipher.doFinal(dataInBytes);
        return encode(encryptedBytes);
    }
```

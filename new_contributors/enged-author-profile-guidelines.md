Welcome to the EngEd program,

Let's begin by creating your EngEd profile.

Be sure to include a short Author Biography and Headshot image[add some guides]. Please include the files in the authors folder within the GitHub repo. 

Your EngEd profile will be important to have updated and presentable as this will serve as a valuable reference to share with peers, potential employers, and the broader technology community.

We also want to make sure you receive credit for all your hard work.

### Create author bio folder structure
Within the authors folder (inside the content folder), create a new folder using the intended author name. (Reference existing folders' naming conventions.)

Be sure to:
- **Use all lowercase.**
- **Use dashes in place of spaces.**
- **Do not include any special characters.**
- **Try to keep it under 40 characters.**
- **Avoid using periods (.) or commas (,) or (_ ) underscores**

Within that a folder, upload your prepared .md file containing a short author description using the filename `index.md`. 

Upload any corresponding headshot image of the author using the file name `avatar`(jpg or png format). Please try to keep this image as close to 600X400 pixels (images can be resized using [Pixlr Image Editor](https://pixlr.com/e)). 

Also, keep in mind that these Enged profiles are intended to be shared and referenced among peers, potential employers, and the broader technology community. Lets do our best to keep them professional.

Add these files to the same PR (pull request).

(See *screenshot* below for file structure.)

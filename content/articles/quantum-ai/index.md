### Overview of Quantum AI

#### Introduction

Quantum Artificial intelligence (AI), as the name suggests, is the application of quantum technology to machine learning procedures. Quantum technology and machine learning are game-changing innovations that will make tasks easier. This branch of  Artificial Intelligence will require a better knowledge of quantum computing and quantum physics.  

Quantum computers store and process data using quantum technology. These computer systems can have substantial advantages to some jobs in that they can work more efficiently. 
A quantum computer stores its data in **qubit** form also known as **quantum bits**. Quantum's system consistency and its connected qubits permit it to be in more than one place at a time. This results in qubits representing several elements once.

### How Quantum AI works

TensorFlow Quantum is a technology with an open-source framework. Its goal is to offer tools to manage and model natural and artificial quantum processes. TensorFlow Quantum blends quantum computing with machine learning.

TensorFlow Quantum can create tensors using quantum data sets, quantum models, and conventional command variables in a single computer network. TensorFlow Operations get the results of quantum experiments that result in classical probabilistic occurrences. Standard Keras algorithms are being used to train it.

To understand how to use quantum data, consider a guided categorization of quantum states by a quantum neural system.  A crucial issue of quantum Machine Learning, like conventional Machine Learning, is to categorize "noisy data." 
To develop and train a quantum framework follow the steps below.

1. Construct a quantum data collection - Tensors represent quantum data. [Cirq quantum network](https://quantumai.google/cirq)  generates  this quantum data and TensorFlow controls all the activities on the system creating a quantum database.

2. Assess the quantum neural system design - Cirq can be used to design a quantum neural system that will then be embedded in a TensorFlow computing structure. Customized quantum systems may be chosen from many groups depending on the quantum's data nature. 
The model's purpose is to use quantum computation to retrieve information concealed in an entangled form. The quantum model frees incoming quantum data and then retains the concealed information stored in classical associations. Hence available to localized measures and classical post-processing.

3. Sample or Average - Quantum form measurement derives classical information from classical randomized variables in samples. The quantum state and the observable influence after the dispersion of values from the random variable. Many variational algorithms rely on average measurement values, also called expectation values. TensorFlow Quantum includes techniques for combining over many runs comprising steps (1) and (2). 

4. Analyze the classical neural systems design - After classical information is retrieved, it is in a state that can be processed further . Classical deep neural channels can extract such links.  It is because the retrieved information will still be contained in classical connections.

5. Cost Function Evaluation - A cost function is assessed based on the findings of classical processing. When the quantum data is tagged, this may depend on how well the model executes the classifying job or other factors if the job is uncontrolled.

6. Examine Gradients & Upgrade Parameters - After examining the cost function, the pipeline's available parameters should be adjusted in a way that reduces the cost. Gradient descent is the known way of doing this.

### Possible application of quantum computing in AI

The workable goal for quantum AI developers is to build quantum algorithms that outperform.

1. Learning quantum algorithms. Quantum algorithms for quantum extensions of classical learning models are being developed. It may speed up or enhance the deep learning training process somehow. By delivering the ideal solution set of weights for artificial neural networks, quantum technology can contribute to classical machine learning.

2. Classical decision issues are stated in decision trees, and quantum methods for decision problems are based on them. Forming branches from particular places is one way to get at the solutions. The effectiveness of this strategy declines when each problem is too complicated to be handled by splitting it into two. Quantum algorithms centered on Hamiltonian time evolution are quicker than random marches in solving issues represented by a set of decision trees.

3. Quantum search: Many search methods are intended for classical computers. Classical computing beats humans in search issues. So, Lov Grover presented his Grover method that quantum computers could solve this issue quicker than other computers. Quantum computing-powered AI might prove promising for approaching uses like encryption.

4. Quantum game theory is a model-based procedure used in AI uses.   The quantum game theory is an extended version of this theory to the quantum field. It can be an exciting tool for solving vital issues in quantum artificial intelligence applications.

### Milestones for quantum AI

Even though quantum AI is still a young field of study, advances in quantum computing increase quantum AI's potential. Yet, the quantum AI sector must reach certain milestones to develop the technology.

The milestones can be summed up as follows:

1. Quantum computing devices that are less error-prone and very powerful

2. Open-source analysis and training frameworks are widely used.

3. A large and well-trained developer ecosystem

4. Quantum computing surpasses classical computing in intriguing AI applications.

These crucial stages will pave the way for future quantum AI advancements.

## Is Golang the Best Fit for embedded systems?

An embedded system combines hardware and software designed to perform specific functions, usually within a larger system. Industrial machines, automobiles, cameras, airplanes, and vending machines are some of the possible use cases of an embedded system. Embedded systems are programmable and utilize languages like C, C++, Python, and Java.

The tech world tries to better the existing systems, and suggestions about using Golang as the primary language in embedded systems have increased. Golang is a relatively new programming language whose popularity has risen with time.

This article analyzes the use of Golang in embedded programming and compares it to the C language.

### What do embedded systems require?
The needs of embedded systems are quite different from those of a traditional computer-based system. Embedded systems mainly require six types of basic requirements to function effectively.

- Performance
- Efficiency
- Reliability
- Safety
- Security
- Usability

We'll discuss each of these requirements in detail, starting with performance.

#### Performance
An embedded system requires the ultimate satisfaction of the timing needs of its operating environment. It entails achieving processing deadlines for specific tasks. Examples of performance requirements are factors such as [energy management](https://www.modernanalyst.com/Resources/Articles/tabid/115/ID/3149/Requirements-for-Devices-Around-Us-Embedded-Systems-Part-2.aspx) (power consumption, battery life, and recharge time). The provisions ensure that a firm or individual can anticipate the effects of sudden voltage drops or degrading hardware components over time.

#### Efficiency
These are the internal requirements that define what others see. They influence how organizations externally assess the performance of an embedded system. Efficiency requirements include resource management factors such as memory, disk space, processor capacity, and network bandwidth. With the architecture and design, such requirements work together to achieve efficiency needs. The requirements specify the maximum anticipated consumption of the various resources in the system, ensuring that designers provide adequate reserve resources for unexpected operating conditions.

#### Reliability
Reliability requirements can be quite stringent, especially for real-time embedded systems. Some systems play life-critical roles. Such systems should offer little or no room for failure. For instance, pacemakers would need their functionality at the top level throughout because a slight deviation puts an individual's life at risk.

#### Safety
Embedded systems should be safe. Organizations must perform a hazard analysis on their production systems to avoid presenting risks to the users. In real-time systems, such as autonomous cars, safety is a key factor because its lack thereof can result in serious injuries. A [fault tree analysis](https://sixsigmastudyguide.com/fault-tree-analysis/#) is critical in assessing the root cause of the safety threats in an embedded system. The safety requirements should be able to determine the system risks and the potential solutions.

#### Security
The security of embedded systems is a topic of discussion because of the rising cyber-attack challenges. These security issues can disrupt critical functions in organization systems. They can disable power plants and interfere with autonomic vehicle control. Protecting embedded systems entails implementing encryption and authentication systems to control data accessibility.

#### Usability
Many embedded systems constitute a human-computer interface that makes them usable. These interfaces must consider various requirements to ensure the best user experience. For instance, display screens for devices should accommodate changing lighting situations. These systems can have multiple options for navigation to cater to the needs of people living with disability, such as the blind.

### Why does Golang fit?
According to [Stack Overflow 2021 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-want), [Golang](https://go.dev/) is one of the top languages developers have expressed interest in developing with it.

In this piece, we seek to reason why Golang fits in building embedded systems. The main reasons are discussed below.

- Go has many core language features and libraries that enhance developers' speed of developing applications.
- As a compiled language, Golang runs efficiently on embedded devices. It also offers broad coverage for cross-compilation, which allows it to support different architectures.
- Golang provides Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packages and many other basic peripherals of embedded systems.
- Golang supports concurrency, which is critical to the efficient running of embedded systems.

### GO vs. C for embedded systems
In this section, we'll have a look at how Golang supports I/O management, memory management, concurrency, and compilation. Based on these factors, we will then contrast Go's performance to [C](https://devdocs.io/c/)'s - another popular language for building embedded systems.

#### I/O management
Golang has an I/O reader that blocks the read method. When reading from a file descriptor or the TCP, the read method is blocked until data arrives or the stream closes.

In contrast, C language allows the reading of multiple streams simultaneously until at least one of them is readable.

#### Memory management
Golang has an automatic memory management system, enabling it to offer garbage collection. This service brings benefits like increased data security and improved portability across operating systems. The garbage collection that Golang offers allows programmers to worry less about managing the memory and concentrate on the application's functionality.

On the other hand, the C language relies on manual memory management. Here, the programmer relies on functions like [malloc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/) to write an object to memory. The programmer enjoys greater control over memory usage.

#### Concurrency
[Concurrency](https://www.educative.io/blog/multithreading-and-concurrency-fundamentals) refers to when an application can deal with many tasks simultaneously while communicating with other programs. Golang is a very efficient concurrent programming language.

C language also has some concurrency, but it is less efficient when compared to Golang. The concurrency in Go is cheaper and easier to achieve. C uses a more complicated concurrency method with complex instruction compared to Golang.

#### Compilation
Compile-time is critical in evaluating the speed at which a programming code converts to machine code. It evaluates the overall speed of the embedded systems associated with each language.

Golang has a higher compile time than C. It is unsurprising considering that Golang purposefully enhanced the ease of coding and speed. It is simple to use and has a readable syntax. However, C is known for its slower compile time, hence, a slow coding speed.

### Golang's weaknesses when building embedded systems
Despite its many benefits, Golang faces some limitations.

#### Lacks support for generics
Developers want to write a code that they can reuse in the future to save on the time and effort of having to rewrite new code. That is one of the weaknesses of Golang, which makes its use in embedded systems limited. Developers would want to retain generic code for various embedded systems because of a need to ensure safety. Since Golang lacks this feature, it can be risky to redo new code from scratch and make life-critical embedded systems rely less on Golang.

#### Lacks support for keyword extensibility
Extensibility in software development refers to leaving some room for future growth. Golang does not support this type of leeway, making it challenging to change keywords in build-in data structures. Golang provides little to no allowance for modifying existing embedded systems, creating a hindrance to upgrades.

#### Lacks manual memory management
Golang lacks manual memory management and instead relies on automation. While the automation features enhance the programming rate, they have their downsides. Automated features may create chaos, leading to overhead garbage collection issues, like pauses.

### Conclusion
Embedded systems are microprocessor-based systems that utilize hardware and software designed to perform specific functions. They are common in small devices like smartphones and fitness trackers and large systems, such as railroad systems. Embedded systems rely on C, C++, Python, and Java programming languages.

Golang is increasingly becoming a popular programming language for embedded systems. Its use in embedded systems owes to its core language features, lower compile-time, TCP packages, high concurrency, and good memory management. Golang appears to be an excellent fit for embedded systems and could overtake primary languages.

###  Ember JS
###  Pre-requisites
- You should know the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the command line.
- Have a basic understanding of some JavaScript concepts like classes, modules, OOP, etc.

 Before diving into Ember.js let's have knowledge about the component service framework which is a key and fundamental concept of Ember.js.

### Component Service Framework
A component-service framework is a popular strategy adopted by companies to create complex UI by breaking it down into small and reusable components. This allows to : 
- Rapidly increase the development rate as working on smaller component take less time.
- Finding bugs is also easy as the code base is precise, small, and easily readable.

### Introduction
Ember.js is a free JavaScript client-side framework for designing web apps that is open source. It is a component-service framework that focuses on the entire online application development experience while maintaining a light layer on top of native JavaScript.  Ember also includes a lot of backward and forward compatibilities, which makes it easier for businesses to keep up with the latest Ember versions and community-driven practices.

Backward and forward compatibilities in terms of software or hardware system that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of Ember API. To read more about it here is the [link](https://emberjs.com/releases/) to the official docs.

### Ember tooling installation
Ember builds and scaffolds sections of your application using a command-line interface (CLI) tool.

-  Before you can install `ember-cli`, you'll need to have node and npm installed. If you don't already have node and npm installed, here is the [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to the official docs.

-  To install `ember-cli`, put the following into your terminal:

```bash
 npm install -g ember-cli
```
`ember-cli` (command line interface) is the official method for creating, building, testing, and serving the files that comprise an Ember app or addon.

The ember program, which is used to construct, build, develop, test, and scaffold your application, is provided via this tool in your terminal (run ember —help for a full list of commands and their options).

-	To make a new application, type the following into your terminal. Inside the current directory, a new directory named `example` is created, which contains the scaffolding for a new Ember app. Make sure you've gone to the correct spot in the terminal before running it.

```bash
 ember new example
```
   Or, on Windows:
```bash
 npx ember-cli new example
```
Once ember installation is compleate, check your ember version. You should see an output similar to this:
```bash ember -v
ember-cli: 2.16.2
node: 7.4.0
os: darwin x64
```
This creates an application development environment that is ready for production and includes the following features by default:

-	Live reloading development server.
- 	Third-party packages can richly enrich your application thanks to the plugin architecture.
- 	Babel and Webpack integration for the newest JavaScript.
- 	Automated testing environment that allows you to test like a user by running your tests in the browser.
- 	CSS and JavaScript transpilation and minification for a production build.
- 	The use of conventions to reduce the variations across applications (allowing easier mental context switching).

Now after getting some idea about ember, let's see an example that will further clarify your idea about this amazing framework.


###  Difference between React JS and Ember JS

###  Performance
###  React 
- React is a JavaScript open-source toolkit that provides a full suite of lean architecture and component-based workflow.
- It is a lightweight platform that is typically used for the display layer of an app while also complimenting other aspects of the app.
- It allows you to reuse components and render JavaScript pages when you have a lot of them. All of this adds to the vehicle's quick speed and excellent performance.

### Ember
- This elephant moves slowly, especially when it comes to rendering. The observe and change recognition are far faster than Angular, however the first render is too slow.
- Because change detection is slower, it enables for the development of large-scale applications with frequent updates.
- It has an effect on the rendering, which makes it extremely sluggish for the first time. Ember works with the most complicated functionality, and the performance measure is different from others, due to the large number of components.

###  Architecture
### React
- React JS doesn't come with a default architecture, so you'll have to rely on third-party frameworks like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). The React plus Flux architecture is frequently used to create web applications.
- React JS is an excellent solution for developing client-side web apps if you want to design a seamless architecture.
- The combination of React and Flux allows developers to create a competent web app that provides users with an exceptional user experience.

### Ember
- When you use Ember's most recent version, it comes with a component-service architecture. Which we already discussed above.

- Ember could be a better alternative if you want to develop apps with more native functionality. Web projects with native capabilities stand out, and the greatest thing is that Ember also supports the GUI framework's URL functionality.

- Ember JS may be said to be capable of handling the application's data interaction. It can adapt to a fast-paced development environment.

### Code Maintainability
### React
- Another point of contrast is code maintainability, where React JS, thanks to its component-based design, can keep the application code structure. All of this minimizes the complexity of the code and the time spent building apps.

- You may emphasize UI features while designing apps with React JS. You may also develop custom hooks and reuse conditional logic many times.

- You may separate application components in a certain way that aids React JS application development. You may break programs into particular portions for accessibility and build easily tested components. 

### Ember
- Ember JS is a fantastic choice if you want to follow good development standards because it prioritizes conventions over configuration. When you utilize Ember CLI and integrated tools for app development, you can keep your applications organized and follow standard configurations.

- The Ember JS setup keeps the code clean and helps to simplify it. As a result, it guarantees that the code is properly organized. All of this helps to trouble-free debugging.

- It allows you to access anyone's code that is simple to grasp and does not require the assistance of a developer.

### User Experience
### React 
- React JS improves the user experience by properly matching development processes with design. You'll discover a number of developer-friendly designs here, where the core community is working hard to provide a uniform user experience.

- React also offers a lot of freedom to developers, but it's critical to use it effectively. You'll be in charge of ensuring that React is at the heart of your ecosystem.

-  The nicest aspect is that React JS's component composition is written in such a way that minor changes don't create any issues or cause the entire codebase to break.

### Ember
- Ember JS is like a vast library of data and tools, therefore you'll find a lot of them here. You may use them all to create your web application however you like.

- Ember CLI and add-ons may be used to construct a pre-testable user interface. They serve as simulated workers and APIs for user interface testing. When you utilise Ember CLI, you may take use of capabilities that aren't available by default.

- More reusable user interface elements may be added with you. Ember JS provides a product-based design with proactive features, allowing it to provide a better user experience in huge projects.

To know more about React here is the [link](https://reactjs.org/) to the official docs.

### Advantages of Ember JS
### Detailed documentation

- Ember's package ecosystem is large and well-developed, so you can be confident in choosing the proper ones to solve your problems.
- The framework has a dedicated website where all of the packages are organized and sorted, as well as detailed documentation and individual ratings.
- It's also possible to make use of the standard NPM packages. Using the command "Ember add-on name," you may quickly build your add-on. Here is the [link](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) for the detailed documentation.

###  Ember CLI
- Ember's "Command Line Interface for Ambitious Web Applications" allows you to interface with the operating system of your machine. This will provide you with a project structure, allowing for quick rebuilds and live reloads.
- This is the main tool for producing codes, doing live recompilations, and running tests in the browser. Most well-known frameworks, like Ember, employ a CLI tool, showing its flexibility.
- Ember CLI allows you to construct a full app in a short amount of time with only one command. It's also possible to figure out what functionalities the program has.

### Community
- The community is one of the aspects cited in the case of many well-known frameworks, and Ember JS is one of them. The debates that take place inside the community are completely transparent and accessible to the public. That's why community support of ember js is widespread and always welcomes any problem regarding the language and well-versed solutions.
- In addition, the library has a large amount of documentation.
- The Ember community meets on a regular basis in over 66 countries, with the most well-known being EmberConf in the United States and EmberFest in Europe.
### Disadvantages of Ember JS
### Tough to learn
- Beginner developers may find Ember to be tougher to grasp than React or Vue.
- It is ideal for complex large-scale programs, but it may be overly hefty for basic small-scale apps.
- The learning curve is steep for beginners.

### Less in popularity
- Ember has had a period of stagnation in popularity over the previous few years, and it has failed to attract any new developers.
- Ember was also failed to gain a spot in Stackoverflow's Developer survey for the year 2020 and just 3.6 percent of active users in the State of JS Survey 2019. 
- If things keep going this way, Svelte JS may soon surpass Ember.

###  Conclusion        
Ember JS allows us to focus on building amazing applications without worrying about the massive overhead that is required to keep an application up and running and it makes life so much easier when we work with complex data in Node.

This is only a small snippet of what you can do with Ember JS, but you have to try it out yourself to see the full power that Ember JS has to offer.

### Introduction
Axios is a library for making HTTP requests. It is a wrapper around the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). It is a promise-based API.

Working in large-scale applications may require a lot of requests from the server. Axios makes it easy to make and manage these requests. However, there might be a need to handle requests to multiple servers.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to make requests to multiple servers.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript.
- Basic knowledge of Vue.js.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports TypeScript.
- An understanding of the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
- A basic knowledge of the Axios library may come in handy, though it is unnecessary.
### Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Make requests to multiple servers.
- Be able to modify the Axios library to understand how it works behind the hoods.
- Add an interceptor to attach authentication tokens.

### What's Axios library?
The Axios library is a wrapper around the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). 

Axios makes it easy to make and manage API requests in Node.js. 

Let's now proceed and create a simple application with Axios to gain knowledge on how it works on a higher level.

To start, install Axios on your project root directory as shown below:
```bash
# initialise the package.json file
npm init
# install the Axios package
npm install axios
```

Next, add the following scripts in your `index.ts` file:
```typescript
// initialise our axios
const axios= require("axios");
axios
    .get('https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education')
    .then((res)=>{
        console.log(res);
    })
.catch(err => {
    console.log(err)
})
```

In the above code, we are requesting the GitHub API. The request is made to the GitHub API, and the response is printed to the console.

In this case, we request the GitHub API to get the user's information named `section-engineering-education`.

Output:
```bash
  login: 'section-engineering-education',
    id: 78109665,
    node_id: 'MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc4MTA5NjY1',
    avatar_url: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78109665?v=4',
    gravatar_id: '',
    url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education',
    html_url: 'https://github.com/section-engineering-education',
    followers_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/followers',
    following_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/following{/other_user}',
    gists_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/gists{/gist_id}',

    organizations_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/orgs',
    repos_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/repos',
    events_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/events{/privacy}',
    received_events_url: 'https://api.github.com/users/section-engineering-education/received_events',
    type: 'Organization',
    site_admin: false,
    name: null,
    company: null,
    blog: '',
    location: null,
    email: null,
    hireable: null,
    bio: `â€œSection's Engineering Education (EngEd) Program is dedicated to offering a unique quality community experience for computer science university students."`,
    twitter_username: null,
    public_repos: 1,
    public_gists: 0,
    followers: 0,
    following: 0,
    created_at: '2021-01-27T20:10:11Z',
    updated_at: '2022-03-01T15:42:41Z'
  }
```

In the above response, as you notice, we can retrieve all details about this site (Engineering Education) from the GitHub API using the Axios library.  

Now, what happens when we want to make this request to multiple servers, let's say [Section](https://section.io) and [GitHub](https://github.com) servers?

In the next section, we will set up our Vue.js application, which will request both the Section and GitHub servers using an Axios instance.

### Setting up the Vue.js application
To set up our Vue.js application, we will use the following command:
```bash
vue create axios-example-app
```

Next, `cd` into the application root directory and run the following command:
```bash
npm i axios
```

Output:
```json
...
 "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.26.1",
    "core-js": "^3.6.5",
    "vue": "^2.6.11"
  },
```

> The Axios version used in this tutorial may differ from your version depending on the time you installed it.

With the Vue application set up, we will now proceed to create our Vue.js application.

In the `src`, create a new directory called `services`.

Next, In the `services` directory, create a new directory called `http/client` and add a file called `client.js`.

Modify the client file as shown below:
```javascript
// we first import the axios library
import axios from 'axios'
// we get the base url from the environment variables
import {apiBaseUrl} from "@/environment";
// we also import the auth service from the modules.
import {AuthService} from "@/modules/auth";
/**
 * Axios basic configuration
 */
const config = {
  baseURL: apiBaseUrl
}

/**
 * Creating the instance of Axios
 * It is because in large-scale application, we may need
 * to consume APIs from more than a single server,
 */
const client = axios.create(config)

/**
 * Auth interceptors
 * @description Add auth tokens to every outgoing request.
 * @param {*} config
 */
const authInterceptor = config => {
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${AuthService.token}`
  config.headers.common.Accept = 'Application/json'
  config.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
  return config
}

/**
 * Logger interceptors
 * @description Log app requests.
 * @param {*} config
 */
const loggerInterceptor = config =>
/** Add logging here */
  config

/** Adding the request interceptors */
client.interceptors.request.use(authInterceptor)
client.interceptors.request.use(loggerInterceptor)

/** Adding the response interceptors */
client.interceptors.response.use(
  response => Promise.resolve(response),
  error => {
    Event.$emit('error', 500, error.response.data.message)
    if (error.response.status === 401) AuthService.logout()
    const errorMessage = error.response.data.message
    error.response.data.message = errorMessage.length > 200
      ? JSON.parse(errorMessage.split('code :').pop()).error.message.split(':')[0]
      : errorMessage
    throw error
    // Promise.reject(error)
  }
)

export default client

```

In the above code, we are setting up the base URL of the API. In addition, we are also setting up the auth interceptor.

Now, we cannot use the basic Axios package to request resources from a protected server.

To make these requests, we create an instance of the Axios package and name it `client`. With this new instance, we can use the `axios.config()`  method to modify this package to attach our tokens.

This is achievable by adding the `interceptor` property of the Axios instance, `client` previously created.

The `config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${AuthService.token}` is then used to attach the tokens required to make requests to the server.

As discussed in the next step, we have also made the Axios response to handle both the success and failure messages.

We then export the client instance to be used in other modules.

Let's now proceed and create our auth service as shown below:
```javascript
// in the src/services/auth/auth.js file
class AuthService {
  // our constructor
  constructor () {
    // create an object with auth details
    this.obj = {
      token: `${process.env.VUE_APP_NAME}_token`,
      user: `${process.env.VUE_APP_NAME}_user`,
    }
    // get the auth token from local storage
    this.token = window.localStorage.getItem(this.obj.token)
    // get the current user from local storage
    this.user = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(this.obj.user))
  }
  // check if user is authenticated
  check () {
    return !!this.token
  }
  // get the token
  token () {
    return !!this.token
  }
  // we getting the current user
  user () {
    return !!this.user
  }
  // logout the current user
  logout () {
    // unset the token and the user
    window.localStorage.removeItem(this.obj.token)
    window.localStorage.removeItem(this.obj.user)
    location.reload()
  }
  // login the user
  login ({ token, user }) {
    window.localStorage.setItem(this.obj.token, token)
    window.localStorage.setItem(this.obj.user, JSON.stringify(user))
    this.token = token
    this.user = user
    window.location = '/'
  }
  // set the value of the current user
  setUser (user) {
    window.localStorage.removeItem(this.obj.user)
    window.localStorage.setItem(this.obj.user, JSON.stringify(user))
    this.user = user
    location.reload()
  }
}
// export the auth service
export default new AuthService()

```

This file is created, with an assumption that your Vue application has an `env` file, otherwise create one at the root of your project and add the following contents:
```env
VUE_APP_NAME = Test
VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/
```

In the authentication script, we first create a constructor function with the initial user setup. We then add a few public methods we can use when importing this auth service.

Now that we have the auth service and the Axios instance defined let's set up an action in our store to request multiple servers depending on the running server.

### Setting up the vue store
To get started with state management in Vue, we need to install a few packages, including the Vuex.
```bash
vue add vuex
```

The above command will prompt you to `yes` or `no` questions, which you should answer with `yes` in this case.

Output:
```json
 "dependencies": {
    ...
    "vuex": "^3.4.0" 
  },
```

> It's, however, essential to note that the above-installed version may differ depending on the installation time.

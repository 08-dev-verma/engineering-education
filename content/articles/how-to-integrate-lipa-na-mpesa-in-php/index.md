Daraja API is an Application Programming Interface that creates a bridge for payment integration to web apps and mobile apps. In your web app, you can create a button that when a user clicks, he/she can initiate payment. There is a button that the user clicks to send a request to Safaricom Daraja upon receiving the request, Daraja sends an STK push which contains the amount that will be deducted from the Mpesa account. The user is prompted to input his/her PIN. Once the user inputs the PIN, the transaction will be processed. The amount will be deducted from his/her Mpesa balance.

### Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, the reader should:
- Have some good knowledge of PHP.
- Have some basics of HTML and CSS.
- Knows how to use XAMPP and VsCode.

#### Goals
- Understand how to create an account in the Safaricom  Daraja API  portal and how to obtain the credentials details like consumer secret key, consumer key, and passkey.
- How to integrate Daraja API with PHP.

### Step 1 - Creating a Safaricom Daraja Account.
To create an account in Safaricom Daraja, open the Safaricom API portal via this link [Safaricom Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/).

### Step 2 - Creating a new app in Safaricom Daraja.
After creating an account, log in and create a new app, and give it a name of your own choice. Take note of the `CONSUMER KEY` and `CONSUMER SECRET` and also take note of `Lipa na Mpesa pass key` which is obtained through simulation of the newly created app because we will use them later.

### Step 3 - We now simulate our new app to obtain Lipa na mpesa pass key.
To simulate the app just click on APIS which is on the menu bar and choose the simulation of Customer to business in order then thereafter we need to select the app that we created and start simulating to obtain the passkeys and business shortcode.

### Step 4 - Creating our Project.
Open visual studio code editor, create a new folder (give it a name of your choice), open it and define a new PHP file and name it as `index.php`

### Step 5 - Designing User Interface.
In this step, we shall design an interface that will prompt the user to enter his/her phone number of their own choice which he or she will use to make payment. The phone number entered should be a Safaricom number which has the amount the user wants to pay. If the user enters the number which does not have anything in mpesa it will not display STK Push but a message will be sent that he/she does not have enough money. Also, the phone number should start with a country code like for example 254727392...

      background-color: skyblue;
      }
   </style>
   <body>
      <center>
         <form style="padding-top: 150px;" action="MpesaTest.php" method="POST">
            <fieldset style="width: 400px; height: 300px; background-color: white;">
               <label style="padding-top: 200px;color:red;">Lipa Online</label>
               <br>
               <input class="input2" type="number" name="amount" placeholder="Enter Amount" style="margin-top: 60px;"> 
               <br><br>
               <input type="number" type="number" name="phone_number" placeholder="enter Phone number">
               <br><br>
               <button class="button" style="color: white; background-color: blue;">
               Make Payment Now
               </button>
            </fieldset>
         </form>
      </center>
      </div>
   </body>
</html>
```
Your final output should be something similar to this:

![Demo1](/engineering-education/how-to-integrate-safaricom-lipa-na-mpesa-in-php/demo1.png)

### Step 6 - Writing our Mpesa Logic.
Define a new file and name it `MpesaTest.php`. This is where we define our Logic that will implement the STK Push on the users' phones. In this code, we will make use of credentials  we obtain from creating the Safaricom Daraja  App

#### Variables Declaration
Inside the file, declare and initialize the following variables using your credentials obtained from an app you created in Safaricom Daraja.

```php
<?php
// Initialize the variables
$consumer_key = 'Lms5EIf2gK16o1sptYPaA3HsfbGUd7fv';
$consumer_secret = 'dgfk1IefQx1SnG1A';
$Business_Code = '174379';
$Passkey = 'bfb279f9aa9bdbcf158e97dd71a467cd2e0c893059b10f78e6b72ada1ed2c919';
$Type_of_Transaction = 'CustomerPayBillOnline';
$Token_URL = 'https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/oauth/v1/generate?grant_type=client_credentials';
$phone_number = $_POST['phone_number'];
$OnlinePayment = 'https://sandbox.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa/stkpush/v1/processrequest';
$total_amount = $_POST['amount'];
$CallBackURL = 'https://2f50f430.ngrok.io/callback.php?key=Your$trongPssWard';
$Time_Stamp = date("Ymdhis");
$password = base64_encode($Business_Code . $Passkey . $Time_Stamp);
?>

```

#### Explanation
- `consumer_key` - This variable assists the developer to access Safaricom API.
- `consumer_secret` - Also this variable assists the developer to access Safaricom API.
- `Business_Code` -Is a business code that receives payment when the customer enters his/her Mpesa PIN
- `Passkey` -After you have created the Daraja App, you will get a passkey.
- `Type_of_Transaction` - Type of transaction to be transacted.
- `Token_URL`-  Authenticate and return the API token used for accessing Lipa Na Mpesa Services in Safaricom Daraja
- `phone_number` - Your Safaricom number that you will use to make payment.
- `OnlinePayment`-For the test environment, pass the Safaricom STK processing request
- `total_amount` - The total amount to be deducted from your account after entering your Mpesa Pin.
- `CallBackURL`-URL use to receive notifications from Mpesa API.
- `Time_Stamp` -Time during which the transaction occurs. It is usually in the format(YYYY-MM-DD).
- `password` -Unique password which is used for encrypting the request.

#### Generating Authentication Token
After declaring the variables, we need to authenticate ourselves to get an authentication token that will enable us to access and get interacted with services provided by Safaricom Mpesa.

```php
//generate authentication token.
<?php
$curl_Tranfer = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_URL, $Token_URL);
$credentials = base64_encode($consumer_key . ':' . $consumer_secret);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Authorization: Basic ' . $credentials)); 
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
$curl_Tranfer_response = curl_exec($curl_Tranfer);

$token = json_decode($curl_Tranfer_response)->access_token;
```
#### Explanation
-`curl_init`-The curl init() method creates a new session and returns a cURL handle. Which will be stored in the variable called '$curl_transfer'
-`curl_setopt` â€” Create a cURL transfer option.
-`CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER`- We set it to be true(1)instead of immediately outputting the transfer, return it as a string of the curl exec() return value.
-`CURLOPT_HEADER`- set it to be false to prevent the inclusion of the header in the output.
-`curl_exec`- Obtain the URL and send it to the browser.
-`CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`- We set the option to be false so that the peer certificate verification succeeds.
 `json_decode`- function that converts a JSON string into an array form.

#### Initiating the STK push on the Users Phone
Next, we will implement a code that will initiate the STK push on the user's phone. Write the following set of codes that will initiate the STK push in the customer's phone which contains the line whose phone number has been entered.

We define a variable ` data2_string` for us to use json_encode on our request parameters. Then, we define a variable called `curl2_response` to execute our curl request.

```php
$curl_Tranfer2 = curl_init();
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_URL, $OnlinePayment);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type:application/json', 'Authorization:Bearer ' . $token));
        
            $curl_Tranfer2_post_data = [
                'BusinessShortCode' => $Business_Code,
                'Password' => $password,
                'Timestamp' =>$Time_Stamp,
                'TransactionType' =>$Type_of_Transaction,
                'Amount' => $total_amount,
                'PartyA' => $phone_number,
                'PartyB' => $Business_Code,
                'PhoneNumber' => $phone_number,
                'CallBackURL' => $CallBackURL,
                'AccountReference' => 'Hillary',
                'TransactionDesc' => 'Test',
            ];

            $data2_string = json_encode($curl_Tranfer2_post_data);

            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_POST, true);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data2_string);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 0);
            curl_setopt($curl_Tranfer2, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 0);
            $curl_Tranfer2_response = json_decode(curl_exec($curl_Tranfer2));

            echo json_encode($curl_Tranfer2_response, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
    ?>      
```
 ### Explanation
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`- This option determines whether the curl verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
- `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` - Set to zero for connection to succeed regardless of the names in the certificate. To ensure that the SSL peer certificates `Common Name` or `Subject Alternate Name` field matches the given hostname
- `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` - Data to POST to server .If you pass a string, int, float, or bool as an input value, JSON encode() will generate JSON that is a basic value (not an object or an array).
- `json_decode`- a function that converts a JSON string into an  array
- `json_encode`-The JSON representation of the specified value is returned as a string.

### Create a form that will contain a button to confirm payment.
```php
<form class="contact2-form validate-form" action="#" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="Check_request_ID" value="<?php echo $curl_Tranfer2_response->Check_request_ID ?>">
   </br></br>
   <button class="contact2-form-btn" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">Confirm Payment is Complete</button>
</form>
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to create an account in Safaricom  Daraja API, create an  App and obtain the credentials details in the newly created app. Also, we have learned how to integrate Safaricom Mpesa STK push, where a user is prompted to enter his/her phone number and the amount he/she wants to pay so as to receive an  STK  push in their phone number that prompts them to enter their Mpesa Pin in order to make payment.

Simple Swap (SimSwap) is a ML framework that aims for generalized and high fidelity face swapping. In contrast to previous approaches that either lack the ability to generalize to arbitrary identity or fail to preserve attributes like facial expression and gaze direction, our framework is capable of transferring the identity of an arbitrary source face into an arbitrary target face while preserving the attributes of the target face. We will give an overview of the framework, how it can be applied in various use cases,  and implement an example to demonstrate how it can be used.

### Overview of DataOps
DataOps is an agile approach for DevOps, data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, developers, and IT operations to support the data-focused enterprise. DataOps integrates technologies and processes with business processes and principles to automate data management and organization.

DataOps adopts agile methodology, DevOps, and lean manufacturing principles. These elements come together to form a comprehensive data architecture that provides valuable insights to any organization's stakeholders. 

1. Agile methodology: Agile methodology is prevalent among software development teams. It allows them to build applications fast. Like Agile, DataOps focus on working on a continuous iteration of development and testing and getting constant feedback. But, with DataOps and Agile principles in place, you can quickly get the correct data and deploy evaluated data models. This speeds up product development and improves communication between development and data management teams.

2. DevOps approach: DataOps is DevOps practices applied to data analytics. Its purpose is to increase analytic velocity and create analytical outcomes for data consumers. DataOps encourages innovative technology to automate data management and operational procedures like DevOps.

3. Lean manufacturing: This process improves the quality of the products and increases the productivity of development teams while simultaneously decreasing waste. Like lean manufacturing, DataOps uses [statistical process control](https://asq.org/quality-resources/statistical-process-control#:~:text=Statistical%20process%20control%20(SPC)%20is,find%20solutions%20for%20production%20issues.) (SPC) to continuously validate data analytics in the pipelines. The ultimate goal is to maintain data quality and eliminate errors.

DataOps provides relevant and high-quality data to customers of specific businesses or organizations. Also, it speeds up the development and execution of automated data workflows. The DataOps concept is more extensive and complex, with different uses depending on the organization.

### Who is a DataOps engineer
As businesses and organizations grow more digital, they must intelligently use massive amounts of data. To achieve this, you may need to hire a DataOps engineer to enable your organization to operationalize its data. DataOps engineers aren't involved with the data. They automate, manage, and integrate processes and workflows. To build data products, they engineer the production environment and processes.

DataOps engineer owns the data pipelines and the general workflow while data scientists and developers operate inside the pipelines. The primary purpose of a DataOps engineer is to assist data engineers and analysts in optimizing their development processes by adapting and applying DevOps principles to the data product workflow.

### DevOps vs DataOps
DevOps and DataOps differ significantly in their implementation and how they work.

The major distinction between DataOps and DevOps is that DevOps handles software development, IT operations, and automated deployment. DataOps, on the other hand, involves utilizing, transforming, and orchestrating data workflows.

DevOps involves continuous integration and continuous deployment of software. It focuses on shortening the software development lifecycle through continuous development and automation. DevOps uses Agile development methodology, which improves time to value by reducing delivery time. As a result, software development projects become more profitable and efficient. DevOps requires collaboration among software developers and the IT operations team.

DataOps involves utilizing, transforming, and orchestrating data workflows. The DataOps technique is a relatively new approach to data analytics that is rapidly gaining acceptance. DataOps requires collaboration among everybody who deals with data across the entire organization.

DevOps requires skills like:
- Software engineering.
- Software development.
- Applications integrations.
- Quality control.
- Quality assurance.
- Development and IT operations.
- Security.

DataOps skills are more diverse. They include:
- Data management.
- Data science.
- Data analysis.
- Data integration.
- Data security.
- Data engineering.
- Statistics.
- IT operations.
- Business.
- Data governance.

With DevOps, code is the most crucial item. However, data is the most critical aspect for DataOps. Software engineers who work with code do most of the work in DevOps. On the other hand, the end-users derive value from the data in DataOps.

DataOps is more than DevOps for data as the world is increasingly becoming data-driven. Organizations no longer keep relying on technology to stay competitive. Data eliminates the need for guesswork when making well-informed decisions. It helps you find new sources of income and allows businesses to find out where the cost center is. Proper use of data determines a company's competitive advantage. Therefore, every organization needs to implement a DataOps strategy.

### Benefits of DataOps
We know what DataOps is, now let us look at how it benefits the businesses:
1. **Make work easier**: DataOps is about automation, which increases the efficiency of workers. With the help of intelligent testing and observation techniques in the analytics pipeline. Teams can maintain their focus on strategic goals.
2. **Better data quality**: Autonomous, repetitive practices, and intelligent code checks are used. You can reduce the possibility of a single human error spreading across multiple servers, causing the network to go down or producing inaccurate results. DataOps increases the value of data by improving the quality of data.
3. **Faster resolutions to problems**: With Agile methodology, you can have data updates in no time. Thus, problems are solved very fast. Reducing toil and enhancing data quality leads to a faster resolution to problems.
4. **Getting a better understanding of data flow**: DataOps can provide an aggregated picture of the whole data flow through time, across the company, and out to end-users. It promotes a better understanding of your data and what it represents.

### Steps of implementing a successful DataOps practice

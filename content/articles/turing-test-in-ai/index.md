The Turing Test in AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a method that is used to test the intelligence of a machine by making inquiries. It tries to test whether a machine can think like a human. The test uses three subjects in its performance, that is, a *human*, a  *machine*, and an *interrogator*.

### History of Turing test in AI
Turing Test as the name suggests  was introduced by Alan Turing in the year 1950 in his article 'computing machinery',  and it aimed at testing whether a machine can think.

The test is based on a party game called the imitation game with its modifications and it involves three players a machine (computer), a human respondent and an  interrogator.The interrogator does the inquiry  while the human respondent  and the computer are to respond to the interrogator. 

The interrogator is usually isolated from the other players for the purpose of identifying which among them is a machine. The players are allocated some unique characters as unique identifiers in their different locations.

The interrogator already knows that one of the players is a machine but it only needs a justification based on making some inquiries and acquiring responses.
Given that one of the players is a machine and its ability to convert text to speech in form of bits  0 and 1, the conversation is done using a screen and keyboard. The results of the test on the machine are based on responses like the human answer.

The interrogator might ask questions like.
**Interrogator:** Are you a man?

**Player x (computer):** NO 

**Interrogator:** convert the following binary digit  into bits (4294967296)

**Player X:** pauses for a while and gives the wrong answer.

This game considers the computer to have passed the test successfully hence intelligent if the interrogator would not distinguish between the human and the machine.
Research conducted shows that to date no machine has passed the Turing Test.

### The performance of the Turing test  
The Turing Test is performed under an interrogation, whereby the test parties, human(person), and the machine are hidden from view to ensure clarity and transparency in the test.s The Interrogator makes inquiries to both the machine and the human at the same time and attempts to identify which among them  is the machine and which is the human  based on the quality of the answers they give.

The test  considers the computer to be an intelligent agent if the interrogator is unable to distinguish between the computer  and the human in terms of their responses.  Then it concludes that  the machine has passed the test successfully and therefore demonstrates human intelligence. That is, it can think. 

### Requirements for passing the Turing test in AI 
A machine is considered to have successfully passed the Turing Test if it is able to meet the following requirements :
 1. ***Natural language processing (NLP)***: It can understand natural human languages.

 2. ***Knowledge representation(KR)***: The ability of the machine to store and retrieve information provided before or during the interrogation.

 3. ***Automated reasoning(AR)***: This requires that a machine is able to use the stored information to answer questions and make new conclusions.
 
 4. ***Machine learning***: This is needed to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

 5. ***Vision***: Vision is needed for  recognizing  the examiner's actions and various objects represented by the examiner.

 6. ***Motor control***: The ability to act upon an object as required.

 7. ***Other senses***: such as audition, smell, touch, etc.

### Features of Turing test
Turing Test requires the following : 

1. **Participants**
The main participants include:
- an interrogator 
- a person(human)
- computer

2. **The site**
This is where the test itself takes place and  where the participiants are kept in separate places.
 
3. **The test** 
It is made by asking questions.  

### Limitations of Turing test 
- The test requires physical interaction which necessitates the need for perception and actuation.

- The test is not reproducible. It uses different code or logic from the original.

- Turing test may not be a necessary test for testing the level of intelligence of a machine since it is not fully guaranteed that any machine that can imitate an intelligent behavior is intelligent.

- It cannot be performed in an open place since one of its requirements is that the players should be in separate rooms to ensure they are hidden from view.

- The test is limited to only testing human-like intelligence.

### Modern-day Turing test  
The modern-day Turing test is an update on Alan's Turing test for testing the intelligence of an AI-based on thought. The test aims at creating Artificial Intelligent agents that can communicate using different modes. It also aims at understanding how far natural language processing NLP has progressed in the past decade and how far it is evolving.
It does not test conversational AI for  intelligence but it tests for the effectiveness of the conversational AI.

Several organizations are working to develop ostensibly human-like conversationalÂ AIs in a variety of conversation and complex styles. A significant social competitive challenge will be to develop a test to determine how human the conversational AI is.

### Conclusion
Turing Test is an  important test in demonstrating the  intelligence of a machine,  whether it can think like a human, which is usually done  under interrogation. 
The test has some critics i.e not everyone accepts the validity of the test.

Passing the Turing test, however,  remains a challenge to most artificial intelligence developers. It is also to be noted that no machine has ever passed the test to date. Turing Test has paved way  for more innovation in the scope of technology.

The Turing Test in AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a method that is used to test the intelligence of a machine by making inquiries. It tries to test whether a machine can think like a human. The test uses three subjects in its performance, that is, a *human*, a *machine*, and an *interrogator*.

### What is Turing test?
Turing Test as the name suggests was introduced by Alan Turing in the year 1950 in his article 'computing machinery'. This test aimed at testing whether a machine can think.

The test is based on a party game called the imitation game with its modifications. It involves three players: a machine (computer), a human respondent, and an  interrogator. The interrogator does the inquiry  while the human respondent  and the computer are to respond to the interrogator. 

The interrogator is usually isolated from the other players to identify which among them is a machine. The players are allocated some unique characters as unique identifiers in their different locations.

The interrogator already knows that one of the players is a machine but it only needs a justification based on making some inquiries and acquiring responses.
Given that one of the players is a machine and its ability to convert text to speech in form of bits  0 and 1, the conversation is done using a screen and keyboard. The results of the test on the machine are based on responses like the human answer.

The interrogator might ask the following questions:

**Interrogator:** Are you a man?

**Player x (computer):** NO 

**Interrogator:** convert the following binary digit  into bits (4294967296)

**Player X:** pauses for a while and gives the wrong answer.

This game considers the computer to have passed the test successfully hence intelligent if the interrogator would not distinguish between the human and the machine.
Research conducted shows that to date no machine has passed the Turing Test.

### Performance of the Turing test  
The Turing Test is performed under an interrogation, whereby the human (person) and the machine are hidden from view to ensure clarity and transparency in the test. The Interrogator makes inquiries to both the machine and the human simultaneously. It attempts to identify which among them is the machine and which one is the human  based on the quality of the answers they give.

The test considers the computer to be an intelligent agent if the interrogator is unable to distinguish between the computer and the human in terms of their responses. Then it concludes that the machine has passed the test successfully and therefore demonstrates human intelligence. That is, it can think. 

### Requirements for passing the Turing test in AI 
A machine is considered to have successfully passed the Turing Test if it meets the following requirements :
 1. ***Natural language processing (NLP)***: It can understand natural human languages.

 2. ***Knowledge representation(KR)***: The ability of the machine to store and retrieve information provided before or during the interrogation.

 3. ***Automated reasoning(AR)***: This requires that a machine can use the stored information to answer questions and make new conclusions.
 
 4. ***Machine learning***: This is needed to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

 5. ***Vision***: Vision is needed for recognizing the examiner's actions and various objects represented by the examiner.

 6. ***Motor control***: The ability to act upon an object as required.

 7. ***Other senses***: These include audition, smell, and touch.

### Features of Turing test
Turing Test requires the following : 

1. **Participants** 
The main participants include:
- an interrogator 
- a person(human)
- computer

2. **The site**
This is where the test itself takes place. The participants are kept in separate places.
 
3. **The test** 
It is made by asking questions.  

### Limitations of Turing test 
- The test requires physical interaction which necessitates the need for perception and actuation.

- The test is not reproducible. It uses different code or logic from the original.

- Turing test may not be a necessary test for testing the level of intelligence of a machine since it is not fully guaranteed that any machine that can imitate an intelligent behavior is intelligent.

- It cannot be performed in an open place since one of its requirements is that the players should be in separate rooms to ensure they are hidden from view.

- The test is limited to only testing human-like intelligence.

### Modern-day Turing test  
The modern-day Turing test is an update of Alan's Turing test for testing the intelligence of an AI-based machine. The test aims at creating artificial intelligent agents that can communicate using different modes. It also aims at understanding how far natural language processing (NLP) has progressed in the past decade and how it is evolving.

It does not test conversational AI for intelligence but it tests for the effectiveness of the conversational AI. Several organizations are working to develop ostensibly human-like conversationalÂ AIs in a variety of conversation and complex styles. A significant social competitive challenge will be to develop a test that determines how human the conversational AI is.

### Conclusion
Turing Test is an important test in demonstrating the intelligence of a machine and whether it can think like a human. This is usually done through interrogation. The test requires participants such as humans, interrogators, and a computer. It also requires a site where the participants are kept in a safe place. 

Although the Turing test is resourceful in the tech industry, its validity has not been accepted by everyone. Passing this test remains a challenge to many artificial intelligence developers. No machine has ever passed the test to date. Nevertheless, this test has paved way for more research and innovation in the field of technology.

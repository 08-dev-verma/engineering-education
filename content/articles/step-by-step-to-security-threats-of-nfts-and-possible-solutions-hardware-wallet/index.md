---
In a world that keeps evolving, a world where technology keeps pushing the human race forward and art captioning our thought and feeling have led to the birth of a new generation.  A million pieces of artwork get created annually, and 1,000,000 of that artwork get stolen. According to the darknet, the stolen artwork market is valued at over 6 billion dollars annually. 

This number is due to the digital era where big tech has led to sending of digital artwork, memes, tweets, music, and video in the form of GIFs and MP4. NFT has become a popular online investment in conjunction with Crypto-currency. Most people ask themselves, what are NFTS, how are they NFTs created, what are the threats to them, are they securities, or are they fraud? In this article, we shall discuss all that. What a topic!!

### Prerequisites
- Basics of Blockchain technology.
- Basics of Web 3.0 technology.
- Basics of NFT technology.

### WHAT IS NFT?
[Non-fungible token]() (NFT) is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items, and videos.  Stored on a publicly-accessible Ethereum blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency.
Fungible means that the token is interchangeable. For example, a dollar, you can swap a dollar with another dollar and still own one dollar.

Non-fungible means they are unique. They can't be swapped as no two NFTs are alike. Many contents have been seen turned into NFTs, including digital arts, movies, and music. of the year 2021, NFTs have exploded into the mainstream leading to the creation of [DEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)Decentralised Financeand  decentralized autonomous organizations[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization).  

In the future, Nft could be used to provide deeds to companies, sell tickets, and provide marriage certificates. NFT allows the buyer to own the original item, it contains built-in authentication, which serves as proof of ownership. Collectors value those digital bragging rights almost more than the item itself.

### The key characteristics of a non-fungible token
- Linkage to physical or virtual assets.Which Expresses the immutable right of possession.

- Verification of the history of ownership. This States that not only digital items can be tracked, but physical items can also be tokenized and represented as an NFT.

### Where to buy NFT
Do you ever ask yourself, where do I buy the NFT? I used to ask myself the same. The most popular sites are:

- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
Valued at over 13.3 billion USD,  the first and largest peer-to-peer marketplace for non-fungible tokens.

- [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)
It is digital art online auction platform for non-fungible tokens.

- [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)
also known as RARI, it a software that allows creators to create and issue ownership of selling custom digital work. It do link sellers with buyers who can select pieces they wish to purchase.

- [Foundation](https://nfoundation.pw/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=g&utm_content=591472369592&utm_term=foundation%20nft)
what a piece of art, a  creative playground for artists, curators, and collectors to experience the new creative economy.

### Examples of NFTS
- [Nyan Cat GIF](https://tenor.com/search/nyan-cat-gifs)
On April 2, 2011, the GIF animation of the cat was posted by 25-year-old Christopher Torres of Dallas, Texas, who uses the name "prguitarman", on his website LOL-Comics.
- [Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-07/dorsey-s-first-tweet-offered-for-48-million-on-nft-marketplace)
Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet has been sold for the equivalent of $2.9m (Â£2.1m) to a Malaysia-based businessman.
- [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

### Understanding NFT's possible threats
- Cyber Security and identity fraud
Last fall, Facebook announced its rebranding and creating a [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse).  The growth of the digital world, blockchain, and the metaverse have led to a growth of a digital asset known as NFT. NFT has resulted in cybersecurity and also fraud cases. With the advancement of new technologies, black hat hackers have found a way to gain an advantage of the system. Hackers tend to create fake stores with the capability to mirror the logo and contents of the original NFT store. 

These counterfeits may be passed off as the real thing and sold. This may lead to a user ending up buying a fake NFT, which leads to copyright issues since there can only be one NFT.

- Identity fraud
Cases of artists having their work sold by others as an NFT, without permission have been on the rise. Scammers have set up unauthorized customer support channels and social media accounts that pretend to be affiliated with NFT exchanges artists and sell fake NFTS with their names, by doing this they also end up stealing customer information and compromising their accounts.

One other prominent non-fungible tokens threats related to cybersecurity and fraud is since any piece of content can be tokenized, 
NFTs that purport to have been created by a reputable source can be passed off as real and sold.

- Vulnerabilities in the smart contract security
In the year 2021, [Cross-Chain Defi Site Poly Network(https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/cross-chain-defi-site-poly-network-hacked-hundreds-of-millions-potentially-lost/) was the headline. De-fi platform Poly Network was attacked, with the alleged hacker draining roughly $610 million in crypto.

According to the report released, anonymous white-hat hackers or hackers successfully stole the fund by exploiting vulnerabilities in the smart-contract code.Poly Network is an interoperability protocol for heterogeneous blockchains, which lets users swap tokens from one digital ledger to another. It is exchanged between several blockchains as users trade one cryptocurrency for another.
Despite the asset being recovered in 15 days, this incident proves that smart contracts cannot discard the risk of cyberattacks.

- Editable metadata
Metadata is structured reference data that helps to sort and identify attributes of the information it describes. Meta is a prefix that
mostly means "an underlying definition or description."since NFTs a digital asset, they contain metadata that defines them. Changing the metadata of an NFT may lead to destroying the rarity aspect of the NFT, as this can destroy its value.  Think of it like painting on top of Monalisa. . Basically, a collector now has a reason not to buy the NFT collection.

- Valuation Challenge
Owners of an NFT may unscrupulously hype an asset to inflate the value, only to cash out leaving others to suffer from the subsequent decline in value. Since the valuation of an NFT is considered by the scarcity and the perception of owners. It gets difficult to anticipate the identity of the next buyer. Therefore, the value of NFTs would depend on how the buyer perceives their price.

- NFT  as a security
After the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/sec-scrutinizes-nft-market-over-illegal-crypto-token-offerings) (SEC) demanded infomation on ceratin NFT, it created a red flag for the NFT. This is according to Cointelegraph. Which led to a fine of $100m issued to crypto trading platform [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/) for falsely labeling high-yield lending products as securities.

### Possible NFTs security solutions (how to secure NFTS)
- Multi-factor authentication 
It's an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to an application or website only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (code or factors) to an authentication mechanism. Different NFT user accounts are easily hacked due to a lack of  MFA authentication.

The presence of MFA authentication tends to lower cybercriminal attacks, this is because the MFA tends to protect user data from being accessed by any other unauthorized third party.

-  Use a unique password for your account
Big tech companies do emphasize on use of a unique and strong password. NFT websites require you to create strong and unique passwords that are also easy to memorize. for example 'Jt5e-79P-B13^qS'. To create a unique and strong password, I recommend you to use special characters, upper case, lower cases, and also digits.

In NFT or any website, Do not use two or more similar passwords in which most of their characters are the same, for example ,
'Drakeyoungmoney34' or 'Drake youngmoney43', makes it easier for hackers to guess and remember if one of these passwords is stolen, then it means that all of these passwords are stolen.

Don't store your password on a password retrieving website, prefer writing down your password on a clean piece of paper.will help you secure your NFTs and crypto-wallets.

- Avoid cold emails and downloading files from strangers 
We all have received an email promoting a company or a document, email seems too good to be true. It is best not to interact with email or QR codes sent by a stranger since they are known to contain harmful malware or viruses. It may lead to a stranger stealing your password or mirroring your screen and later compromising your account by stealing 
your Nft or stealing your identity.

-  Smart contracts transaparency
Smart contracts are useful programs that live in a blockchain and are executed on demand.On the other hand, smart contracts play a  role in NFT  transactions. They remove the outcome and third parties. Smart contracts are used to enforce and build trust in blockchain technology. 

The standard use allows them to execute automatically. They form the building blocks of any NFT. Since they are used by several 
enterprises and have massive implications for both media and digital platforms, it is recommended to customize the smart contract limit when approving a transaction.

-  Regularly update your software.
The future of Nft is getting brighter with time.Raising security concerns is also increasing. Make sure the NFT software runs smoothly by regularly updating to the latest version of the software available for your device. It helps in fixing bugs in the driver software each new update to a software reducing little ''hiccups'' that may slow your service or lead to cyber threats.

- secure internet connection
Securing your Internet connection at home is essential to protecting yourself from online threats and enjoying peace of mind when you go online. Lowering the risk of hackers getting in touch with your-NFT accounts and your hardware wallets.

There are different types of wallets. They are mostly described as both software and hardware. Here are some of the top NFT wallets available right now.

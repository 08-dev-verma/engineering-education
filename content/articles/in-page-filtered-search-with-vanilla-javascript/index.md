### Introduction
You should allow visitors to search through a lot of data on a website if you have a page to find what they're looking for.  In my definition of "search," I don't mean browsing through a database or even JSON data; I mean searching through the content of a single web page. Make it easier for our users to find what they want by giving them a search option that breaks down the website into different parts.

### Overview of In-Page JavaScript Filtered quest
You may already be familiar with JavaScript. A large part of this trip's responsiveness javaScript will take care of it. It'll;
- keep track of all the material we need to examine,
- keep an eye on what a client writes into the inquiry box,
- route the accessible components' `innerText`,
- check to see if the text contains the search word (.incorporates() is the big one! ), and
- Toggle the permeability of the (parent) components, depending on whether they contain the query phrase or not. 

Okay, we've covered our bases! We should get to work right away.

### A fundamental layout
Let's admit we get a FAQ file. A'cards' with a label and accompanying text is there for each problem:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

   <meta charset="UTF-8">

   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

   <title> Vanilla Javascript filtered search</title>

</head>

<body>

   <h3>Questions and Answers Section</h3>

   <div class="Crds">

       <h5>identity Representation</h5>

       <span>It's been around for five centuries, and it hasn't altered much at all since the advent of computerized typesetting.As a result of this, it gained widespread recognition.</span>

   </div>

   <div class="Crds">

       <h5>Discover all</h5>

       <span>It's been around for five centuries, and it hasn't altered much at all since the advent of computerized typesetting.As a result of this, it gained widespread recognition.</span>

   </div>

   <div class="Crds">

       <h5>Why we do it</h5>

       <span>It's been around for five centuries, and it hasn't altered much at all since the advent of computerized typesetting. As a result of this, it gained widespread recognition..</span>

   </div>

   <div class="Crds">

       <h5>Collaberation Involved</h5>

       <span>It's been around for five centuries, and it hasn't altered much at all since the advent of computerized typesetting. As a result of this, it gained widespread recognition.</span>

   </div>

</body>

</html>
```

Be prepared for a flurry of inquiries on the subject.

To get ourselves ready for the intuitiveness, we'll only use one line of CSS. When we go to JavaScript, we'll have a class that we can add/remove based on the current situation:

```css

.hidden-element {

       visibility: hidden;

   }
```
It would be a good idea to include a query input that triggers when it associates with:

```html

<label for="searchArea">search</label>

   <input type="search" name="srch" id="queryBox" oninput="queryContent()">
```

### An example of a JavaScript basis
Finally, here's the JavaScript that handles the rest!

```javascript

let queryContent = () => {

       let Crds = document.querySelectorAll('.Crds');

       let query = document.getElementById('queryBox').value;
       let i = 0;
       while(i < cards.length){
         if (Crds[i].innerText.toLoweCase()

               .includes(query.toLowerCase())) {

               Crds[i].classList.remove('hidden');

           } else 

               Crds[1].classList.add('hidden');

           }
       }
       i++;
   }
```

You may interpret the code by going through it line by line. It keeps track of every cards and the information it contains and retains a record of it. Whenever a hunt event begins, it scans all the cards to see whether the specified text is there. To display the card, the. The -covered-up character must be removed; if not, the class remains in place, and the card stashes away.

### Creating a lag
So that our JavaScript doesn't run too many times, we'll only do our live Search work after lifting for "X" seconds.

```html

<label for="searchArea">search</label>

   <input type="search" id="searchArea">
```

```javascript

let timer;

   let interval = 400;

   let inptBox = document.getElementById('searchArea');

   inptBox.addEventListener('keyup', () => {

       clearTimeout(timer);

       timer = setTimeout(queryContent, interval);

   });

```

### What about lookups that use fuzzier terms?
For example, suppose you need to read through a piece of content that the customer won't notice. The idea is like a fluffy hunt, where related catchphrases return a similar outcome as a precise match. There is an increase in the number of cards used to "match" queries. These two options are available to you. We'll begin with an approach like a "secret range," but with catchphrases in place of the numbers:

```html

<div class="Crds">

       <h5>Why we do it</h5>

       <span>It's been around for five centuries, and it hasn't altered much at all since the advent of computerized typesetting. As a result of this, it gained widespread recognition..</span>

       <small class="hidden-element">secret</small>

   </div>
```

Reloading our liveSearch results is the next step, instead of using `.innerText`, we'll use `.textContent` to include tucked-away parts.

```javascript
while(j < sampleCrds.length){
  if (cards[i].textContent.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())) {

           sampleCrds[1].classList.remove('hidden-element');

       } else {

           cards[i].classList.add('hidden-element');

       }
       j++;
}
```
Contingent upon your necessities, you could place your watchwords in another property.

### Difference between innerText and textcontent
- **Node.textcontent**

`TextContent` is a property of the Node interface that contains `textcontent` shared across a `node` and its  successors.

- **Difference from innertext**
  
Don't misleads the distinctions between Node.`textContent` and HTMLElement.`innerText`; they are not exclusive. Although the names appear to be identical, there are significant differences:
- Including the `script` and style elements, `textContent` obtains the content of all the components in the document. 
`InnerText`, only displays elements that are "human-readable."
- `textContent` provides a list of all the elements contained within the `node`. `innerText`, is mindful of styling and will not return the text of components that have been "hidden."

- **Difference from innerhtml**

Element. Exactly as its name suggests, `innerHTML` returns HTML. `InnerHTML` can be used to get or write text within an element, yet, `textContent` is more performant because its value is not parsed as HTML and hence has a smaller memory footprint.
Furthermore, the use of `textContent` can help to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) assaults.

### Caveat
Aside from that, this is not a search engine that uses a database or any other type of information feed. It will only function if you have all the searchable material on the **DOM** page and that content has before been rendered by the browser. So there you have it. It was a reminder.

### Conclusion
I like this procedure enough to use it on a creation site. Be that as it may, by what other method may you? Is this something you'd use? Although a FAQ page is a rising star, you may use it in any situation that requires sorting content. 
Using the hidden information scam might even use a display of images to search at the alt label content of the images. 

Regardless, I trust your view as this supportive. 

Happy coding!

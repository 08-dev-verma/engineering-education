## Bridge to Kubernetes: The Perfect Replacement for Azure Dev Spaces

The advancement of technology has simplified software development over time. The world is now shifting towards microservices as the basis for creating apps and software to bypass the shortcomings of large-scale web applications. Azure Dev Spaces helped make this transition possible, but its limitations meant that it would not be an ideal option for the future.

Bridge to Kubernetes is becoming the perfect replacement for Azure Dev Spaces. They both share similar roles of making debugging and integration testing smooth in the Kubernetes setup. But they also have their differences.

This article discusses Bridge to Kubernetes and Dev Spaces and gives an overview of how Bridge to Kubernetes works. It also explains why Bridge to Kubernetes is a perfect replacement for Dev Spaces.

### An overview of Bridge to Kubernetes
Bridge to Kubernetes is a development tool used to create microservice applications for Kubernetes. The tool makes it possible to debug microservices on your developments. You can debug code on your development computer while maintaining a connection between the Kubernetes cluster and the rest of the applications. Without Bridge to Kubernetes, you'll need to deal with a large microservice architecture. The many interdependent services become problematic when replicating those dependencies on a development computer.

Bridge to Kubernetes does not build and deploy code to your cluster. Instead, it opts to connect your cluster with the development computer directly. This option makes the debugging process fast, facilitating quick testing and development of software and application services.

Besides, Bridge to Kubernetes helps redirect the traffic between your development computer and the Kubernetes cluster. Its role is facilitating communication between services running in your Kubernetes cluster and code on the development computer. Besides, Bridge to Kubernetes enables you to quickly create and modify your code without a need to replicate the dependencies manually.

### An overview of Dev Spaces
Dev Spaces is a traditional alternative to Bridge to Kubernetes. But the inception of Bridge to Kubernetes led to the eventual abandonment Dev Spaces by several tech organizations and individuals. Like Bridge to Kubernetes, Dev Spaces allow you to build and deploy code within a Kubernetes cluster. [Azure Dev Spaces](https://azureinfohub.azurewebsites.net/Service?serviceTitle=Azure%20Dev%20Spaces#) facilitates the creation of software and microservices apps with minimum development machine setup. It makes it possible for developers to live-debug on Azure Kubernetes Services.

[DevSpace](https://devspace.sh/) is an open-source tool for Kubernetes that lets a developer create and deploy software to the cloud faster. Its roles include building, testing, and debugging apps inside Kubernetes. It also automates repetitive tasks for image creation and deployment. Besides, DevSpace unifies the deployment workflows during development and staging processes. It runs as a single binary CLI tool and does not need a server-side component because it is in direct communication with the Kubernetes cluster.

### How Bridge to Kubernetes simplifies microservice development in VS Code
Microservice apps have several services that work together to accomplish desired functionality. Each of these services has a specific configuration attached to its dependencies, making setting up and running the app complex. It can also be pretty time-consuming; hence, the need for Bridge to Kubernetes. Bridge to Kubernetes connects the development workstations to the Kubernetes cluster. Its intervention removes the need for the manual configuration of external dependencies on the development workstation.

In VS Code, Bridge to Kubernetes supports all languages, provided that one can run them locally. Upon installing its extension on the VS Code, it becomes possible to run Bridge to Kubernetes in Visual Studio. Bridge to Kubernetes helps VS Code developers to create and deploy microservice applications faster. It facilitates quick debugging and [end-to-end testing](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/10/07/bridge-kubernetes.aspx), ensuring that software and app development and release happen fast. Bridge to Kubernetes provides an improved experience with greater capabilities than Azure Dev Spaces. It makes the process of microservice development quicker and less complicated.

### How Azure Dev Spaces differ from Bridge to Kubernetes
Bridge to Kubernetes and Azure Dev Spaces are more similar than different. They both share in a flurry of functions. Notably, they both accelerate microservice development and guarantee easy debugging of code. They also offer end-to-end testing of developed software and apps. Even so, their minima differences play a critical role in the choice of development tool that an organization can pick. Many organizations have leaned towards Bridge to Kubernetes because of its functionality that is a bit superior to Azure Dev Spaces.

#### Differences
Bridge to Kubernetes offers a lighter-weight option to the various development scenarios that Dev Spaces can support. Its overall experience is an improvement over Azure Dev Spaces due to its enhanced capabilities. As such, Microsoft sets to take Azure Dev Spaces off the tech market in October [2023](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-dev-spaces-is-retiring-on-31-october-2023/).

Some of the differences between Bridge to Kubernetes and Azure Dev Spaces include:

- Bridge to Kubernetes is lightweight, simpler, and more accessible than Azure Dev Space.
- Bridge to Kubernetes is highly modular. Its components are easy to swap, unlike Azure Dev Spaces.
- Bridge to Kubernetes supports the multi-cloud world, private, public, and hybrid services.

#### Shortcomings solved by Bridge to Kubernetes
The replacement of Azure Dev Spaces with Bridge to Kubernetes help solve various shortcomings of DevSpaces:

- Using Azure Dev Spaces to build and deploy code to your Kubernetes cluster is slow and time-consuming. Bridge to Kubernetes overcomes this problem by skipping the need to build and deploy to the Kubernetes cluster. Instead, it directly connects the Kubernetes cluster with the development computer.
- Azure Dev Spaces is a little complex as a debugger for code. Bridge to Kubernetes is simpler to operate and offers greater flexibility than Dev Spaces.
- Azure Dev Space requires manual configurations, which Bridge to Kubernetes helps bypass by adopting a more automated approach.

Beyond overcoming these shortcomings, Bridge to Kubernetes's higher capabilities enable it to take advantage of the fidelity and scaling of running inside Kubernetes clusters. Besides, Bridge to Kubernetes side-steps the need to have Kubernetes configurations, allowing the developers to focus on the business logic of their code.

It is notable how advantageous replacing Azure Dev Spaces with Bridge to Kubernetes would be in the long term. When using Bridge to Kubernetes, the only other requirement for running and debugging your code is just the microservice you are building and your development tools. The developer enjoys more control and can write, debug, and test their application's code while still connected to the rest of the services. This workflow ensures that developers save on the costs and complexities of dealing with extras like Dockerfile. This Bridge to Kubernetes setup is favorable when dealing with large applications.

### Final thoughts
Azure Dev Spaces and Bridge to Kubernetes are essential application development tools. They are critical during the development and deployment stages because they help write and test the code. But Azure Dev Spaces' limitations have made it a liability in microservice development, paving the way for Bridge to Kubernetes.

Bridge to Kubernetes comes to solve the shortcomings noted in Azure Dev Spaces, making microservice app development more efficient. Notably, it eliminates the manual configurations seen in Dev Spaces by introducing an automated approach. Also, it improves the speed of debugging, making code processing quicker during application and software development. Bridge to Kubernetes is also simpler to operate and offers greater flexibility than Azure Dev Spaces. Undoubtedly, Bridge to Kubernetes is the perfect replacement for Azure Dev Spaces.

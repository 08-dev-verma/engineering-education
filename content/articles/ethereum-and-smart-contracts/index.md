From the [website](https://ethereum.org/en/), Ethereum is a community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications. The platform is open source and allows two parties to make reliable transactions based on cryptographic proof. The technology that powers Ethereum is known as blockchain. [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a system of decentralized nodes, comprised of a network’s resources of each connected device where transaction data is distributed and stored using a consensus algorithm. That means that all the parties under the blockchain network protocol must approve the state of the ledger to increase trust of unknown peers in a decentralised environment.
The Ethereum network gives developers the power to deploy smart contracts and decentralised applications, [dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/).

Smart contracts are scripts of code which can facilitate the exchange of money, shares, content, or anything of value. Smart contracts are formed using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). These smart contracts will execute without any downtime, censorship, or influence from a third party.

In this article, we will discuss how Ethereum works, its disruptive technologies, and the smart contracts ecosystem.

### Understanding Ethereum and smart contracts

As we discussed in the introduction, blockchain is a chain of blocks that contains information.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger that
is completely open to anyone.



Each block contains some data, the hash of
the block and the hash of the previous block.
Hash identifies a block and all of its contents
and it's always unique. But there is one more way that blockchains
secure themselves and that's by being distributed. Instead of using a central entity to manage
the chain, blockchains use a peer-to-peer network and anyone is allowed to join. When someone joins this network, he gets the
full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to verify that everything
is still in order. Now let's see what happens when someone creates
a new block. That new block is send to everyone on the
network. Each node then verifies the block to make
sure that it hasn't been tampered with. If everything checks out, each node adds this
block to their own blockchain. All the nodes in this network create consensus. They agree about what blocks are valid and which aren't. Blocks that are tampered with will be rejected by other nodes in the network.

Ethereum network provides the access to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) – a decentralized blockchain computer where developers can build smart contracts and embed them into the application. It’s a virtual computer where all Ethereum contracts are executed.

The EVM is deterministic in that given an input of a smart contract executing on an EVM, will always produce the same output. This is essential becoz the blockchain will need to achieve its functionality by ensuring that all blocks agree on smart contract results, and reach consensus.

Eth has ability to run smart contracts(agreement programmed into code)
Are tamper-proof and automatically execute
E.g betting on tommorow's temp, make a smart contract to hold our money and pay the winner
Neither can cheat, change rules, or prematually withdraw
   

 A smart contract is an automated agreement that’s fully executed with code. The computer specifies and stores the conditions for the enforcement and termination and makes sure that both parties receive equal outcomes.

<!-- 
A smart contract can be defined as a self-executing contract which is intended to digitally control and enforce the negotiation of a contract. Smart contracts are almost indistinguishable from regular contracts, except that the agreement of a contract is automatically enforced in real-time on a blockchain.

This greatly facilitates the efficient conduct of an agreement, since it excludes the presence of intermediaries and provides more accountability. 

Why are blockchain-based contracts considered as beneficial?

With smart contracts, you can virtually exchange everything (money, shares, real estate, etc.) and verify shipments and payments in real-time, while saving businesses time and money. 

So, with the popularity of blockchain-based contracts rising across all levels of government, healthcare, and the real estate industries, enabling technology for other sectors is only a matter of time. A concise example of blockchain technology use in smart contracts is given below.

### Common blockchain and smart contracts use cases

Some industries that are currently used include:


__Voting__
__Supply Chain__ : The New Era of Logistics
__Lending Money__
__Insurance claims__

__Security__
__Banking__

### Conclusion

As a digital platform, ethereum gives developers a platform to build a wide range of decentralised applications such as security systems, voting systems, payment methods, and more. With blockchain in a gradual rise as the new standard of trust, blockchain and smart contracttechnology has the capability to be the mover and shaker of the [fourth industrial revolution](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-4ir/).

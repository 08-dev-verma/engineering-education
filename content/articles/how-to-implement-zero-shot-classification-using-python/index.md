Machine learning is an ever-evolving field. One area of machine learning that has evolved greatly over the span of a few years is Natural Language Processing (NLP). The [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) organization has been on the forefront in making contributions in this field. This tutorial will leverage the zero-shot classification model from huggingface to extract model predictions and perform multi-class classification.

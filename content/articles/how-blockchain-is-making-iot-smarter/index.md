## How Blockchain is Making IoT Smarter

IoT applications have increased tremendously, and so have those for blockchain. The universal expectation in the IT world is that blockchain plays a significant role in the communication between IoT devices. The major problem facing the complementary relationship between IoT and blockchain is IoT's reliance on centralized platforms.

Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize IoT. It could become the ultimate solution to the data security challenges facing the Internet of Things. Its ability to duplicate transactions and disperse them across networks of nodes does the trick. This article focuses on understanding how blockchain contributes to making IoT smarter.

### How blockchain solves IoT security and scalability challenges

#### IoT security
As more connected devices go online, fundamental security risks have risen exponentially due to the lack of protocol standards that regulate these interactions. Blockchain seeks to solve these security challenges by implementing a tamper-proof framework. The kind of encryption it utilizes makes it impossible for another user to modify or delete existing records.

The transactions conducted using blockchain are verifiable. Thus, only transactions coming from trusted parties can undergo successful transmission. Blockchain adds a layer of security that blocks malicious threats from finding their way into the IoT data.

Blockchain has other security mechanisms that make its implementation in IoT a significant step towards ensuring data safety. Notably, it embraces decentralized control of data and the proof of work concept. Decentralized management of IoT data means that no single entity or user can control the massive amount of data generated and transferred using IoT devices. This makes the data transmission process more transparent and challenging for hackers to target an organization's data.

The [proof of work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) (PoW) concept means that an authentication process verifies data eligibility after every transaction in the network. This process aims to avoid counterfeits created by duplication. Once a transaction undergoes this process, it remains in the system undeletable and unmodifiable. Thus, eliminating the risk of loss of records.

#### Scalability challenges
IoT experiences several scalability challenges owing to various reasons, such as:

- **Low processing power and storage** - several IoT devices, like smart sensors, have small processing and storage units that cannot support running security protocols, such as [Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Security Socket Layer (SSL)](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/secure-sockets-layer-transport-layer-security/).
- **Lengthy sessions** - many security solutions rely on having a shared encryption key that remains valid during an entire duration of that session. In this case, long-running sessions become problematic, as is the case for IoT devices. Hackers can wiretap the line and track the communication patterns to discern shared information.

Blockchain is keen to solve the scalability challenges by facilitating the fast processing of transactions among several IoT devices. Even as more IoT devices join the network, the blockchain always finds ways of incorporating them without compromising the processing speed of the requested transactions.

Blockchain also attends to the scalability issue using sharding. This solution achieves scalability by subdividing the network into smaller easy-to-manage parts called shards. It then runs these parts parallel to each other. Because each shard handles a specific portion of data, the processing output increases considerably in the network. Sharding is a form of horizontal scaling, and it gives blockchain the capability to have near-limitless scalability.

### How blockchain complements IoT
Combining IoT with blockchain offers promising results to improve performance and security for devices connected to the internet. One of the goals of integrating these two technologies is to enhance the tracking and recording of all transactions in a network and any accompanying changes.

In particular, blockchain complements the Internet of Things by:

- **Enhancing security** : blockchain technology provides a data security solution by implementing ways to verify data in a network. IoT devices receive data from billions of other nodes on the network. But because of blockchain, they do not risk suffering harm from malicious programs. Blockchain can detect and weed out data from untrusted parties and encrypt data from verifiable and trusted devices. The mode of functioning of blockchain means it maintains high transparency. A user can determine who has access to specific data in the network. Besides, blockchain adds a security layer that prevents any user from overwriting existing data in a network.
- **Reducing costs** : automation of transaction validation and processing enables an entire IoT system to function cost-effectively without sacrificing efficiency.
- **Increasing the speed of transactions** : blockchain acts as a shared ledger for supply chain transactions involving multiple producers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers. Thus, parties can exchange data directly without manual procedures.

### Use cases of blockchain and IoT
Blockchain and IoT are applied in many real-life situations. Consider the following examples.

#### Tracking vaccines
Blockchain's capability to record transactions for all the involved parties in a supply chain network at each stage of a product made it crucial for vaccine shipment. This solution prevents the distribution of counterfeit doses in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Pairing blockchain with IoT enhances the tracking of these vaccines during pandemics such as COVID-19.

For instance, if a driver transporting the vaccines stops on the way and exchanges them for something else, it could become challenging to track this if it weren't for IoT. IoT installed sensors in trucks detect when it stops and the stoppage point. Working this way, blockchain and IoT ensure that the original vaccines reach the intended location. Successful applications of blockchain and IoT have occurred in [British Hospitals](https://www.iotforall.com/blockchain-iot-covid-vaccine-shipments) and helped track the transportation and temperature conditions of the stored COVID-19 vaccines.

#### IoT-based self-driving cars
As blockchain matures and the demand for driverless cars continues to rise, the possibility of using this technology to manage, store, and transfer data is becoming a reality. Blockchain can secure shared information relating to vehicle identification, warranties, possession, wear, tear, etc.

Through blockchain implementation, interactions between self-driving cars would become manageable. The technology can assess nearby drivers' behavior using smart sensors fitted in the vehicles. The collected data helps optimize risk assessment using predictive analytics and induce actual maneuvering of nearby vehicles to prevent accidents. Besides, using blockchain's decentralized system, autonomous cars can access traffic data more accurately, helping drivers make intelligent driving decisions.

More importantly, blockchain can solve the challenge of data security that comes with autonomous cars that rely on online traffic data for navigation. There is always a risk of malicious attacks impairing driving functions, potentially causing road accidents. But since blockchain's security is almost impenetrable, it could help revolutionize the safety of driverless cars for the better.

### The challenges of integrating blockchain technology with IoT
Integrating blockchain with IoT comes with a fair share of challenges. Following are examples of such drawbacks.

#### Diminishing storage capacity and scalability
The chain is growing at a rate of one megabyte for every 10 minutes in Bitcoin, for instance. The rate keeps overgrowing, and there is concern that this will become unsustainable in the long run. Besides, an oversized chain could have negative implications on the performance of blockchain, such as an increased synchronization time for the users.

#### Loss of data privacy
While blockchain ensures data security, it does not entirely guarantee its privacy. One of blockchain's key features is its decentralized system that provides transparency at every stage. This means that users can see and track each transaction happening in the system from first to last. This system builds trust between the users but has a knock-on effect on privacy because an entity loses its anonymity.

#### Legal issues
Blockchain lacks a central authority because of its decentralized system. And this is one of the things that make it an attractive venture for its users. However, many governments oppose its institution, fearing that an uncontrolled transaction system could create high volatility risks. So, some nations have set laws that regulate the use of blockchain technology, creating uncertainty about its global implementation.

### Conclusion
IoT devices are now everywhere. Electronic gadgets in every home and organization transmit massive amounts of data online. With increased IoT device connections also comes the threat of data security. That is why blockchain implementation in tandem with IoT is now crucial in safeguarding data. Blockchain's decentralized system verifies data transmitted throughout the chain to ensure no malicious attack can reach the IoT devices.

Blockchain's capabilities made it crucial in monitoring the COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Autonomous car manufacturing companies are also considering using the tech to make their driverless cars malicious threat-proof. Even so, blockchain faces fierce contention from several governments that feel the system could disorient the typical financial systems of their nations.

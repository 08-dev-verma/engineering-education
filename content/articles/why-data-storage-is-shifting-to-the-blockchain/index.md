## Why Data Storage is shifting to the blockchain

The most embraced form of data storage was the traditional in-house data centers in the recent past. However, cloud storage started to replace it. Cloud storage came with the promise of greater efficiency and more data storage capacity, which attracted many businesses.

In the same way, cloud storage is now facing competition from blockchain technology. Blockchain promises to solve data security challenges - an issue that is a great threat to cloud storage. With blockchain data storage, companies and individuals could enjoy the kind of data transparency not seen before. Companies are interested in this new technology hoping that it could revolutionize data storage for the better.

This article discusses blockchain as a more secure and flexible alternative data storage system. It also gets the reader to prepare for what to expect of blockchain as a data storage solution.

### Blockchain storage vs. cloud storage
When assessing cloud storage and comparing it to the blockchain, you realize immediate differences between the two systems. Data storage, data security, and data structures differ between these two technologies. 

#### Data storage
The cloud is a virtual space where you can access data remotely. You gain access to the cloud by surfing the internet.

Blockchain storage is a little dissimilar because it is an encrypted system that uses different methodologies to encrypt and store data in protected databases. Blockchain is built so that the system keeps the data across several nodes that form a consensus on the exact position of the data.

This storage method is different from the cloud, where data remains in one location and is easily accessible to an individual as a whole. The way blockchain stores its data in small chunks distributed throughout the network adds a security layer. If an individual or entity breaks into the system, they can only access a fraction of the data rather than the entire file.

#### Data structures
In cloud storage, data is mutable, while in blockchain, data is immutable. The cloud storage system is set up to let you change the already stored data. These modifications affect how another user perceives the data after the changes are made. Users cannot adjust the already existing data in the blockchain; the system prevents this from happening. You cannot delete or modify existing entries. This helps secure data from tampering.

#### Data security
Cloud storage relies on third parties to ensure data security. It provides services using the Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service models. Blockchain guarantees data protection and integrity without involving third parties.

Besides, data in the cloud can exist as either public or private. However, in blockchain, data is always public. Blockchain embraces transparency, meaning that an entity cannot hide data from other users. It enables individuals on the blockchain to track how data moves from one point/user to another.

### Costs implications of storing data on the blockchain
Unsurprising, such a storage technology that threatens to 'overthrow' cloud storage and offer a highly secure system has many cost implications. In the last few years, the costs for implementing and running a blockchain system have [risen](https://content-blockchain.org/newsarchive/2017/07/20/exploding-costs-of-storing-data-on-a-blockchain/) tremendously. 

One reason for this is the increasing acceptance of blockchain technology has led to a rise in data transmission and storage costs. Besides, the high demand for blockchain services has driven up cryptocurrency prices.

There are specific factors that keep the blockchain functioning normally. These also contribute to increased blockchain usage costs. In the case of bitcoin, the nodes and miners contribute significantly to rising costs. The miners [assemble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp#) valid Bitcoin transactions in blocks, enhancing data security. For Ethereum, Gas is the fuel that maintains its routine running. Miners receive payment for their services; you must pay for Gas.

The cost of Gas is [0.00000005 ETH](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/costs-storing-data-blockchain-rohan-pinto), and by storing a 256-bit word, you could use up as much as 20,000 gas. A kilobyte would take 640,000 gas, which translates to a cost of 0.032 ETH. Based on the current value of this cryptocurrency (2,672.32 USD), that is equivalent to 85.51 USD. 

Now consider storing as much as 1 gigabyte of data. The cost would go as high as $32,000. That amount is unsustainable for most entities, given that medium enterprises transact terabytes of data. Unless blockchain finds cheaper options, the costs for storing data on the system could push out some entities and make blockchain storage solutions limited to only a few.

### How blockchain is transforming cloud storage

#### Enhancing data security
Blockchain is actively transforming the face of cloud storage and its approach to data management. In particular, combining the two technologies has paved the way for the modification of cloud storage to create blockchain-based cloud storage that has several benefits. The transformation of cloud storage helps solve many challenges while advancing the existing capabilities to offer greater performance and efficiency in data management.

Blockchain-based cloud storage has led to increased security and efficiency in data handling. This newly modified system enables users to interact in a secure peer-to-peer (P2P) network that utilizes a decentralized system. This feature of blockchain technology helps ensure data security. In a decentralized system, data remains distributed across several nodes, ensuring that any unauthorized party cannot access an entire data file for a given company. This is one of the weaknesses that cloud storage experienced, and incorporating blockchain is a perfect solution.

Additionally, the encryption keys in the blockchain ensure that unencoded document transmission remains accessible to the end-users only. The aim is to protect the data from reaching public access before its encryption.

#### Safeguarding data from modifications
One of the recurrent issues that cloud storage experiences is the likelihood that stored data may undergo alterations in the hands of authorized users. Blockchain's system ensures that does not happen by preventing any changes to original data. These include edits and deletions, meaning once an entity feeds data into the system, it remains for all to see afterward.

Blockchain offers a confided approach that tracks and affirms that an existing database has not experienced any changes. The method ensures that data retains its original format.

#### Ensuring transparency
With blockchain, transparency is not an option that an entity has to make. The model allows any user to observe all data transactions made on the network. This makes it possible to track how data moves from one point to another in the network. This aspect is also essential in validating the transactions in the network.

Cloud storage embraced a model that allowed privacy to thrive for a long time. Transparency was an option for an entity then. Companies could hide some or all of their data from user access. The transparency issue can discourage companies from implementing blockchain. However, even with this reduced privacy, data security remains uncompromised. Besides, the high transparency comes with increased trust between clients transacting data amongst themselves in the network.

#### The current blockchain storage products available
Blockchain is still at its early level of development, and only a few companies have managed to develop products related to this technology. Some of the known blockchain storage products include [Storj.io ](https://www.storj.io/)and [Sia.tech](https://sia.tech/technology). [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is another product that lets individuals mine Filecoin by sharing storage space.

### Conclusion
Cloud storage plays a significant role in offering safe online data storage. But data security threats continue to exist, with many organizations losing finances after data loss or alterations following cyber-attacks. Blockchain promises to ensure data security through its decentralized system that permanently limits data modifications and deletions.

As organizations explore blockchain implementation, there is no denying that it has its share of challenges. In particular, its rising costs are a discouraging factor. As the tech world continues exploring options to lower the costs of storing data on the blockchain, it remains a viable option for companies whose desire to uphold data security outweighs the associated costs.

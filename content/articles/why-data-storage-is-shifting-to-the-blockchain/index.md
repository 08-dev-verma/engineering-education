## Why Data Storage is shifting to the blockchain

Some years ago, the most embraced form of data storage was the traditional in-house data centers. But it was not too long before cloud storage started to replace them. Cloud storage came with the promise of greater efficiency and more data storage capacity that attracted many businesses.

In the same way, cloud storage is now facing competition from blockchain technology. Blockchain comes with the promise to solve data security challenges - an issue that cloud storage has found challenging to deal with exhaustively. With blockchain data storage, companies and individuals would enjoy the kind of data transparency not seen before. Thus, many companies are opting for this new technology with the hope that it could revolutionize data storage for the better.

This article discusses blockchain as a more secure, cost-friendly alternative data storage system. It also gets leaders prepared of what to expect of blockchain as a data storage solution.

### Blockchain storage vs. cloud storage
When assessing cloud storage and comparing it to the blockchain, you realize immediate differences between the two systems. For a start, the cloud is a virtual space where you can access data remotely. You gain access to the cloud by surfing on the internet.

Blockchain storage is a little dissimilar because it is an encrypted system that uses different methodologies to encrypt and store data in protected databases. The blockchain is built in such a way that the system keeps the data across several nodes that form a consensus on the exact position of the data.

This storage method is different from the cloud, where data remains in one location and is easily accessible to an individual as a whole. The way blockchain stores its data in small chunks distributed throughout the network adds a security layer. It ensures that if an individual or entity breaks into the system, they can only access a fraction of the data rather than the entire file.

In cloud storage, data is mutable, while in blockchain, data is immutable. The cloud storage system is set up to let you change the already stored data. These modifications affect how another user perceives the data after the changes. Users cannot adjust the already existing data in the blockchain because the system bars them. You cannot delete or modify entries already made, which helps secure data from tampering.

Cloud storage relies on third parties to ensure data security. It provides services using the Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service models. Blockchain chooses to guarantee data protection and safeguard its integrity without involving third parties.

Besides, data in the cloud can exist as either public or private. However, in blockchain, data is always public. Blockchain embraces transparency, meaning that an entity cannot hide data from other users. It enables individuals on the blockchain to track how data moves from one point to another.

### Costs implications of storing data on the blockchain
Unsurprising, such a storage technology that threatens to 'overthrow' cloud storage and offer a highly secure system has its share of financial challenges. In the last few years, the costs for implementing and running a blockchain system have [risen](https://content-blockchain.org/newsarchive/2017/07/20/exploding-costs-of-storing-data-on-a-blockchain/) tremendously. One reason for this is the increasing acceptance of blockchain technology has also led to a rise in data transmission and storage. Besides, the high demand for blockchain services has also driven up cryptocurrency prices.

There are specific factors that keep the blockchain functioning normally. In the case of bitcoin, the nodes and miners are responsible. For Ethereum, Gas is the fuel that maintains its routine running. Miners receive payment for their services, and in the case of Ethereum, one must pay for Gas.

The cost of Gas is [0.00000005 ETH](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/costs-storing-data-blockchain-rohan-pinto), and by storing a 256-bit word, you could use up as much as 20,000 gas. A kilobyte would take 640,000 gas, which translates to a cost of 0.032 ETH and, based on the current value for this cryptocurrency (2,672.32 USD), that is an equivalent of 85.51 USD. Going by that, now imagine storing as much as 1 gigabyte of data. The cost would go as high as $32,000. That amount is unsustainable for most entities considering that medium to large firms transacts in terabytes of data. Unless blockchain finds cheaper options, the costs for storing data on the system could push out most entities and make blockchain storage solutions limited to only a few.

### How blockchain is transforming cloud storage

#### Enhancing data security
Blockchain is actively transforming the face of cloud storage and its approach to data management. In particular, combining the two technologies has paved the way for the modification of cloud storage to create blockchain-based cloud storage that comes with several benefits. The transformation of cloud storage has helped solve some of its challenges while advancing its existing capabilities to offer greater performance efficiency regarding data management.

Blockchain-based cloud storage has led to increased security and efficiency in data handling. This newly modified system enables users to interact in a secure P2P network that utilizes a decentralized system. This is a feature of blockchain technology, and it helps ensure data security. In a decentralized system, data lies distributed across several nodes, ensuring that any unauthorized party cannot access an entire data file for a given company. This is one of the weaknesses that cloud storage experienced, and incorporating blockchain would help to mask it.

Additionally, the encryption keys in blockchain ensure that un-encoded document transmission remains limited to the end-users only. The aim is to protect the data from reaching public access before its encryption.

#### Safeguarding data from modifications
One of the recurrent issues that cloud storage experiences is the likelihood that stored data may undergo alterations in the hands of authorized users. Blockchain's system ensures that does not happen by preventing any changes to original data. These include edits and deletions, meaning once an entity feeds data into the system, it remains for all to see afterward.

Blockchain offers a confided approach that tracks and affirms that an existing database has not experienced any changes. The approach ensures that data retains its original format, which is critical for security purposes.

#### Ensuring transparency
Another transformation that comes with adopting blockchain into existing cloud storage solutions is increased transparency. With blockchain, transparency is not an option that an entity has to make. The model allows any user to observe all data transactions made on the network. This makes it possible to track how data moves from one point to another in the network. This aspect is also essential in validating the transactions in the network.

Cloud storage embraced a model that allowed privacy to thrive for a long time. Transparency was an option for an entity then. Companies could hide some or all of their data from user access. The transparency issue can discourage companies from implementing blockchain. However, even with this reduced privacy, data security remains uncompromised. Besides, the high transparency comes with increased trust between clients transacting data amongst themselves in the network.

#### Current blockchain storage products available
Blockchain is still at its early level of development, and only a few companies have managed to develop products related to this technology. Some of the known blockchain storage products that one can avail of include [Storj.io ](https://www.storj.io/)and [Sia.tech](https://sia.tech/technology). [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is another product that lets individuals mine Filecoin by sharing storage space.

### Conclusion
Cloud storage has played a significant role in offering safe online data storage for many years. But data security threats have continued to exist, with many firms losing finances after data loss or alterations following cyber-attacks. Now blockchain offers to ensure data security through its decentralized system that permanently limits data modifications and deletions.

As organizations explore blockchain implementation, there is no denying that it has its share of challenges. In particular, its rising costs are a discouraging factor. It is 10000-times more expensive than cloud storage currently. As the tech world continues exploring options to lower the costs for storing data on the blockchain, it remains a very tempting option for companies whose desire to uphold data security outweighs the associated costs.

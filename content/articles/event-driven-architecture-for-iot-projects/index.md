## Why do you Need an Event-Driven Architecture for Your IoT Projects?

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is gaining popularity as an architectural pattern for IoT projects. As the demand for faster development cycles increases, it is crucial to have a model that facilitates scalability and other complex functional requirements.

EDA provides many benefits to IoT development. For instance, it enhances agility in IoT devices. This article compares EDA to traditional models and shows why EDA is increasingly critical for IoT projects.

### Event-driven architecture (EDA) vs traditional model
EDA and the traditional model differ in many ways. Following are some of the most notable differences.

| Traditional Model | Event-driven architecture |
| --- | --- |
| It requires the client to keep pulling requests for a given issue and wait for a response. This method can be inconvenient, especially when data keeps changing. It is more efficient for static data. | The EDA system is reactive. It automatically sends information about changing events to the customer. With this system, the customer remains updated about any changes in the system. |
| The model requires that the service be available when the client pulls the request; otherwise, it may go unanswered or cause response delays. | Events sent to the clients do not require replies; they occur unprompted. The system does not need to know that the consumers are available to execute events. |
| The process modification is more complex. When installed logic requires any changes, there must be some updates to the service. | It does not need similar changes, as you can make modifications without any explicit process alterations. |
| Any data changes erase previous information about state changes. | The system records and retains the history of every change that occurs, providing a truthful journal about all the alterations made to data in a given time frame. |
| Streaming analytics face the limitation of being unable to record data changes from multiple sources simultaneously. | EDA can record data in flight, allowing for continuous intelligence in a computer system. |
| It supports synchronized communication and recording of events, ensuring that obtained intelligence is consistent. | EDA's asynchronous data recording from multiple sites concurrently means it can be challenging to align the facts because there is no chronological alignment of the timelines. |

### Why do you need an EDA?
An event-driven architecture is a system of loosely paired microservices, facilitating the sharing of information based on the produced and consumed events. You need an EDA system because it can help you to receive messages and direct them to specific services that need them. Consumers who receive these messages can understand their progress with streaming services and decide which messages they should subscribe to based on the logs they read from the beginning. An EDA model provides the following benefits:

#### Decouples the producer from the consumer
An organization may need to implement an EDA to help decouple itself from the consumers. The advantage of doing so is that you concentrate less on how the consumers receive and react to the services you produce. 

Similarly, the consumers concentrate less on the production of those services. The decoupling process makes it easy for consumers and producers to focus on their tastes and preferences. So, the service reaches whoever is willing to consume it.

#### Provides resiliently to event-creating systems
EDA is popular because of the resiliency it provides to event-creating systems. The loose coupling of the EDA components means that services may have fewer concerns about the integrity of another service. Loose coupling ensures that microservices within a system can keep operating even if one fails. Later on, the system can pick from where it failed and accomplish that specific task.

#### Supports a push-based messaging system
You need an EDA to implement a push-based messaging system. EDA works with intermediary brokers to facilitate push message service where customers can receive product updates without needing to do polls. They receive immediate results, which makes the interaction efficient.

### The flexibility of an EDA
One of the advantages of EDA is its flexibility. You can create a truly decoupled microservice-based architecture with event-driven architecture, ensuring higher flexibility to software development. The EDA system can relay the same message to millions of clients daily without experiencing downtimes. One of the reasons for this is its flexibility to accommodate an increasing number of microservices.

For instance, an EDA can accommodate 50 or more identical microservices that work independently to perform a similar task. These microservices schedule and perform messaging services without any duplication. The ability of the system to variably accommodate several microservices makes its flexibility crucial for the efficient functioning of an EDA system.

### Event-driven architecture and the IoT

IoT has become a popular topic in today's tech industry, and its possibility of combining with EDA makes it even a more attractive venture. One of the things that come with the internet of things is the increased data companies have to process. It keeps rising as more IoT devices get connected.

Much of this data requires real-time processing. EDA supports the real-time processing of events; thus, companies must consider incorporating it alongside IoT. EDA allows faster, efficient, and accurate handling of data generated from multiple sources.

With IoT, an organization can receive and disseminate information severally per day before storing it in the cloud. Processing should be responsive to the current client requests, making EDA a critical approach to adopt for IoT. EDA handles several queries simultaneously, ensuring that the consumers receive information quickly.

### Why you need an event-driven architecture for IoT projects

#### To deal with rising data traffic
IoT projects need EDA as data traffic rises with devices getting more connected. Notably, IoT projects require the flexibility that comes with the EDA model. For instance, with EDA, they can modify existing logic without tampering with the real-time processes. EDA ensures that IoT projects avoid the risk of losing previously compiled data.

Similarly, graphic user interface-based applications with an EDA may allow a single mouse click to provide several different responses. This is critical, especially when handling IoT projects because it adds to the range of commands they can perform.

#### To reach final consumers through mass targeting
With an EDA, a firm does not send data to a specific IoT component but rather several of them at once. The aim is to reach consumers by mass targeting. This approach reduces the need for the producer to find a consumer who has a specific interest in their products. Doing so allows the system to be aware of everything without repeatedly asking for information through polls. For instance, a company can know that specific consumers have no interest in their products based on their choice to unsubscribe from their message services.

Combining EDA with IoT projects helps reduce latency. In the tech world, many applications require immediate access to information. Thus, minimizing the need to have point-to-point integrations for data sharing can help lower the latency to milliseconds.

#### To make informed decisions
Also, implementing an EDA in IoT projects facilitates the undertaking of informed decisions. EDA ensures situation awareness and accurate information necessary to make correct business decisions. Apps must respond to constantly changing business solutions during event streaming. Since this process occurs in real-time, the EDA approach becomes the most suitable in ensuring that IoT devices can keep up with the handling of emerging data.

### Conclusion
Event-driven architecture is a popular option because of its high flexibility and ability to enhance faster software development cycles. But its importance to the IoT is another crucial aspect. IoT comes with the challenge of big data because of the increasing number of data transmitting devices.

Through EDA, IoT devices can handle data more efficiently. EDA makes real-time event streaming possible. Consumers can receive responses for their requests simultaneously, ensuring that devices incur less latency when accessing data. Event-driven architecture is unarguably a better replacement for the traditional model.

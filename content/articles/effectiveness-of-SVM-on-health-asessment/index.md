Effectiveness of support vector machine (SVM) in health assessment

### Introduction

Advanced global health is one of the critical priorities among world leaders, researchers, and organizations. In advancing it, the idea of using algorithms in extracting hidden information from medical data has attracted a lot of attention. One of the critical significance of data analysis is identifying a key pattern. The pattern is significant in determining factors that can be vital in diagnosing some medical issues.

[Support vector machine](https://www/engineering-education/supervised-learning-algorithms/) is one of the critical algorithms vital in regression, classification, and outlier detection. It has been very promising to address the health problem with minimal computational power accurately. Researchers have reported its ability to detect various health conditions such as cancer, blood pressure, and diabetes. SVM is likely to make a significant revolution with increased seriousness in global health problems.

The article focuses on assessing how SVM can diagnose and prognoses various health conditions using medical data. The article also highlights the reasons to why SVM is effective in handling medical data.

### How SVM is used in health assessment

SVM is a critical [supervised machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning) model used in handling various sets of data to resolve multiple problems. SVM could be used in determining health problems using the different ways as discussed below;

#### SVM classification

Classification is the primary way through which SVM can do a health assessment. SVM is capable of performing both multiclass and binary classification of data. Classification of medical data is vital for clinical coding transforming it into standardized statistical code. For example, classification subdivides the data in diagnosis or procedure code to analyze critical information. The classification is based on various parameters related to health assessment issues.

##### Binary classification of data using SVM

The binary classification is the task that can be categorized into two classes. When the data has precisely two categories, SVM can be used sufficiently. SVM starts by classifying data by identifying hyperplanes, which can separate data points based on some parameters. There are various [hyperplanes](https://www/engineering-education/kernel-svm-in-python/), with the best being the most significant margins, common inseparable data. However, in non-separable data, SVM uses soft margin to separate some data, if not all.

##### Multiclass classification of data using SVM

Natively, SVM does not support multiple-class classification. However, it can now be used in breaking data into multiple classification sets. The multiclass type can be done with either one-to-one or one-to-rest approach.

The one-to-one approach breaks the multiclass problem into a wide range of multiple binary classifications. Thus, there is a binary classifier on each pair of classes achieved. There is a need for a hyperplane to separate two types ignoring the third class in this approach. Thus, the approach doesn't consider points that splint outside the two categories.

One-to-rest approach breaks multiclass problems into a binary classifier per class. The hyperplane is used in separating the course from all other points. The approach takes into account all the medical data into consideration.

#### SVM in data regression

SVM is vital in determining the relationship between the variables based on the medical data. The SVM in regression uses the same principle as classification. For example, the hyperplane is individualized, and error is tolerated. SVM uses the classes to reflect the relationship between them. In most cases, SVM uses the Kernel trick, especially in handling non-linear data.

#### SVM in outlier detection

SVM is significant in medical assessment in detecting outliers. They usually significantly affect statistical results since they can mislead the interpretation of data when undetected. The one-class SVMs have been termed as very efficient in offering outlier detection.

### Health condition prognosis and diagnosis using SVM

SVM, through the above ways, can diagnose several health conditions as discussed below;

#### SVM in cancer asessment

SVM is one of the robust algorithms vital in the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer. SVM is a classifier system that is used for the diagnosis of various types of cancer. The pre-processed database is first split into testing (independent) and training datasets. The training data is used in the building of SVM classifiers. They are built to the point of maximum classification accuracy. Based on the classification, the analysis of predictivity, specificity, sensitivity, and error rate are done.

For example, SVM classifiers are used in the diagnosis of breast cancer. SVM makes accurate breast cancer classification. Based on various features that define breast cancer, SVM classification prognosis and diagnosis from mammogram image data. The datasets close to the hyperplane are more likely to assess predictivity.

#### SVM on diabetes asessment

An SVM model is also vital in the diagnosis of diabetes. The critical parameters based on a diagnosis of diabetes through SVM is body mass index, age, and blood glucose concentration. There are three main classes of output that are partitioned through SVM. The classes include people with diabetes, with the predisposition of diabetes, and without diabetes. A regression analysis to reflect the relationship between the features shows how they affect the HGC level. SVM algorithms have a high accuracy level in predicting diabetes through classification and regression.

#### SVM in Hypertension/blood pressure asessment

Support vector machine is also vital in diagnosing hypertension through classification and regression analysis. The SVM first performs the classification of data using an N-dimensional hyperplane separating the dataset into two classes. Predictive analysis is done using support vector regression based on the classification to determine whether the parameters affect the health issue. SVM has been very accurate in prognosis and blood pressure diagnosis compared to other vital algorithms.

### Why should you use SVM in health assessment?

SVM offers good accuracy compared to other algorithms in health assessment. The accuracy is mainly high when the data is non-linearly and linearly separable. The accuracy is high in linear separable since all the variables are included efficiently with separating hyperplane. SVMs are easily interpretable with an efficient classification which enhances the predictive accuracy on health problems.

SVM is easy to implement and straightforward. It can deliver better performance within a short period. Thus, using SVM is more suitable in addressing various health problems.

SVM is very effective, especially in high-dimensional spaces. A high number of features usually characterizes this compared to the observations. The complexity of the model is basically (n-features\* nÂ² samples), thus, effective in handling non-dimensional data. SVMs use various hyperplanes in such a space to see that separate classes are created sufficiently.

Finally, SVM is memory efficient. It can store all data, primarily affiliated with the training, and use it efficiently in decision-making.

### Shortcomings affiliated with SVM

Despite the wide range of reasons for choosing SVM in health assessment, there are various shortcomings while using the model. The following are some key reasons;

SVM is not efficient in handling large sets of datasets. In large datasets, the training time is very high, with classification being difficult due to slow training. The target classes in a large dataset usually overlap, affecting the classification and predictability.

Another critical shortcoming is affiliated with setting the parameter correctly. For accurate classification, parameters need to be identified accurately, which may mislead the analysis. The parameters for one classification may not work for the second problem; thus, accuracy is key

### Conclusion

Therefore, SVM is one of the critical machine learning models that effectively handle medical data. The algorithm can accurately help in diagnosing various health conditions such as cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Three critical ways SVM operates medical data are through classification (both binary and multiclass). Other methods include regression and outlier detection,

One of the main reasons for choosing SVM in health assessment is its accuracy. Other reasons include its ease and straightforwardness and its memory efficiency. However, the use of SVM has some shortcomings, such as the inability to handle a large set of data and dependency on parameter accuracy.

Therefore, SVM is an essential algorithm that can revolutionize health by enhancing accuracy in diagnosing and prognosis of illnesses.

In this edge-based hackathon, we will focus on Sections [Kubernetes Edge Interface (KEI)](https://www.section.io/docs/explanations/kei/) solution. KEI is a simple Kubernetes deploy process. KEI makes many edge clusters appear as a single cluster, enabling developers to quickly and easily deploy applications across a distributed Edge.

To participate in this hackathon, EngEd students are expected to create a true k8 app for the Edge that is deployed using the KEI process. Register for the Hackathon using this form.

Review the judging criteria listed below.

Below you will find full details on the hackathon and any requirements.
